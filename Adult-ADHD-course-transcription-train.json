Guys, so this week is on commanding your attention. So those specific strategies that you can use in the moment, that a conducive, particularly for people with ADHD to be able to focus in those times. So what I was talking about is highly related to this\u2014just jumping back to the last session. Did anyone explain I didn't actually read the last slide last session because I was like, I just got there. But the question was going to be like, take a couple of these strategies and use them to better explain ADHD to someone in your life who knows it better. I don't know whether anyone caught that, but even if that wasn't a specific homework task that was there, did anyone take any of the knowledge from last week and utilize it to explain it better to anyone they know? It's okay because I didn't even ask you to. I was just curious if you did. When I started learning, when I was confident that I knew enough about ADHD, like, that was when I was okay with telling my dad, who I fully expected, not to think it was a good idea or believe that there was any utility in it. And I was right. But that's okay. At least I could explain it. Well, he's 70. You can imagine. He basically said, \"Try not to over medicalise things, son.\" This is a generational gap that I imagine that many people are kind of dealing with when it comes to explaining this to some of the older people in their life."

        "value": "If I always do that thing, which I feel is the only reason why people like me, and I always do it, I never get to see whether it's okay, whether they hang around anyway when I don't do that thing. So then I don't actually get any evidence over time to prove that it was no longer necessary or never necessary. So it means kind of building up that courage, finding the places that you can do it in some way, and building that up so that you can build up that evidence to yourself that it's not required. So there's courage and there's risk and everything like that in there. This can be very challenging, potentially, but that's another driver to potentially say yes to things that you might not have the resource or the time or ability to do at that stage. Saying no is a skill, and it does take practice. Spotting when, as I was talking about on the last slide, and also doing it well, which is this next slide of the art of saying no. So instead of using the word no, say exactly what or when was like, what you can do or when you can help, that kind of thing. So it's like if you imagine it as like, no is like a wall, right? So, like, somebody wants to go forward, they're like, can we do this thing? Can we go forward? It's like no block. And then they're like, they hit that wall, and they're like, all they want to do is find. A way around that is because they're being stifled, right? But if instead all you're saying is something like, look, I can do that, but look, I've got to do this first. It will take me this long. Let me know if you still need help in 20 minutes or I'll come up and ask once I've done that. So you're giving them a chance to figure it out on their own, which, I mean, we know if it's like a workplace situation where somebody's asking for help, that usually people figure it out on their own. If they're given the time, they will often ask the question of somebody more senior or who they expect to know the answer because it's easier than, you know, going looking up and stuff like that. Now, there is like, I can help you for half an hour, but I do have to go at that time. And then you could actually set the alarm in front of them so they see you doing it, so that it's like, okay, right, I know he's got that alarm. It's not going to be a surprise when your alarm goes off in half an hour because you've said, yes, that's the time I've got. They've seen you set the alarm. So when that goes off, it's like, okay, I do have to pop over. Generally speaking, that'll be a fine time to leave if it was, like, out of the blue and it wasn't actually preempted and it was just like you're helping and then your alarm goes off and you pop off. It could be taken well, but it's less likely to be taken well than when they have that full kind of pre-understanding of what's going to happen. Look, I have to do this, the thing at hand and I'm feeling pretty swamped, but such and such over there might be able to help you. And that's pretty much like a straight no in a sense, right? But it's still that sense of like, there isn't a wall of like, you must stop. It's like, okay, so I can't but it's like but you might be able to go there. It's like if you think of martial arts or something like that, it's the equivalent of Pichi countering versus direct block. And it does tend to actually make a pretty significant difference in the way that people take things in the amount that they're likely to be like, oh, come on, you can do it, mate. Come on. Whatever it is, depending on the situation how they would try to kind of twist your arm to do the thing, is much less likely to happen if it's done in one of these ways. Now, note that people respond better when given a direction instead of war, just generally. And note two, that if people are not used to having boundaries from you, it may take some time to adjust. So if you've had a pattern in the past of acquiescing and doing things for people beyond your resources. So you're like people are used to you always saying yes, even if it's not the best thing for you. Then they may they're kind of trained to expect whatever we do. Right. So then the next time they would be like their expectation would be that you'll probably do it because you have in the past. And if you have decided that you're going to redefine the notion of what people pleasing means in your life and you don't want to do that anymore, then that might mean ruffling some feathers in the meantime. Right. Like it has been the case sometimes where like through helping people, through people pleasing or low perception of themselves, low self-esteem and stuff like that, but sometimes it will mean then like if people have been taking advantage of them but then they're a bit stifled and it's not like everybody is going to remain around. It is possible that through doing those things for people we invite people into our lives that primarily want things from us. Right. And those people are not likely to be consistent friends, but the people in general who are closest to us, who we care about, who we know there's some relationship beyond just trading, doing things for one another or whatever it is, they don't go. Those friends are still there and they become the proof that you don't need to do the people pleasing. So do you take things on that you shouldn't? What are the pressures you most often give in to let's have a longer chat today and what workshops and situations we have that reoccur for us."

And it's that point I want to get out of that I want to come into work or whatever. I do anything task related. I want to be able to sit down and go, I know what I need to work on first, and then for the rest of the day instead of going, I don't know what to do, where do I start?"

        "value": "So there's kind of two things in that to do with just gaining a better perception of how long things take. Imagine the best way to do that would be perhaps to like, even if it's one project that you've got throughout the week, to estimate what is the time that it takes, note that down, chunk up the time, and then particularly note so start and finish time of actually getting into that task. And just to know the difference between this is what I estimated, this is how long it actually took, and just doing that over time for people, even with just like one or two things at a time will just improve your sense of how long things take, even without really specifically thinking into it, having said that. And that would help down the track in terms of being able to think about what you need to do first, but that wouldn't be the most direct way to get there in terms of gaining that ability to know when to start and to start quickly. My suggestion for people, in that case, is usually to pick, like, to spend, say, ten minutes at the end of the day before just planning very quickly. This is the first couple of things that I'm going to do so that you can stick that as a sticky note on your computer or just have that as a notepad on there. So then when you come in and you could even like, close down other programs and open if it's a computer task, all that kind of stuff. So when you come in you're like, right, this is the task. Get cracking. Like when I used to study and actually go into uni, especially because I wanted to chat if I wasn't constantly keeping myself busy, that I would always have, like, a notepad there with just, like, dot points of a couple of things ahead so that when I finished whatever task I was doing, there was no kind of floundering chatting for half an hour or whatever. It was just like, what's next? That good. So then it stops at that moment. So I guess they're two different things in order to more directly move into one or the other part of what you're wanting to overall achieve."

Just because I did realise of an evening, I am knackered, and I'm just distracted. So I was working on it during the day, in the mornings and things like that, and I just smashed it out. I'm like, that was simple. Not simple, but that was a lot less complex than I thought it would be."
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Yeah, it can be a really powerful technique for people just to pick the time of day just because so many people I've talked to, particularly those with ADHD, describe themselves as night hours like that. The time they focus. Some people get into the pattern of preferring that and stuff like that. But I've not found a situation so far where we have modified that from getting things done at nighttime to some other time when they're more focused in the morning or something like that where it hasn't ended up being an improvement. So, of course, no matter what time of day or night we tend to get focused that we will have, our system will be prepared to get focused to some degree at those times. So our circadian rhythms, that kind of 24-hour plane that will dictate when we have access to melatonin and GABA so that we can sleep and whatnot, will also give us it will upregulate norepinephrine at the times that we tend to focus. So if people tend to focus at maybe like late at night, then that's the time that they will find that they kind of start to get revved up. Just because that's been a pattern of behaviour that your system is trying to keep you prepared for. And oftentimes, people will say, like I'll be feeling reasonably tired, and then it gets up to like eleven or whatever time it is, and then I like I feel pumped up, ready to go again. It's like dollars to doughnuts; the pattern of behaviour that has led there has been actually getting revved up at those times. Whatever we do will end up being the thing. Just like I think I may have mentioned in the past that another thing that is regulated by circadian rhythms is a hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin makes us feel hungry around our lunchtime, sorry, around our meal times. And if we eat at a consistent time throughout the day, then that's when we're going to get a spike. And we know that because if you wait like an hour and a half to 2 hours after your it's about an hour and a half after your meal time normally goes over, then you'll find that hunger, that kind of feeling like your stomach's eating itself, it's all gone. Because it was very much like highly, highly related to ghrelin. When people fast for multiple days, and I have done up to three days myself where you find that you get the first day, you get the biggest spikes of the grill and the biggest hunger during those meal times. On the second day, you have a bit more baseline hunger at the start of it, but the spikes of ghrelin and hunger that you have around meal times are lower, and toward the end of the day, it gets easier. So they've graphed up when people find subjectively the most difficult time or when they're most hungry when they're fasting, and it's between about 20 and 24 hours, or 20 and 28 hours after that time, people find that it gets easier. And like, even to the point where, very surprisingly, you know, you can be two days into a fast and realise you're not hungry. So that was a divergence. But it's worth noting that being a spike of it, like if we snack at nighttime, then we will naturally start to crave food and feel hungry at nighttime. Because that's time we've eaten and we can get rid of that. In the same vein, when people do intermittent fasting for those who have never spent it only takes about seven to ten days or a week to a week and a half to reset their skating rhythms. For those who haven't done that with so just like not eating breakfast, for example, once they've done it for a week or two where they've just not eaten breakfast, they won't get hungry at those times anymore because they stop having that spike of growling. Hopefully, that's useful instead of diving in there."

So were you diagnosed with ADHD predominantly inattentive? Yes, I just jumped to that because most people I find who are diagnosed as adults tend to have the inattentive presentation, not all, but it's just that I find it's more likely to be missed earlier on when people have the inattentive presentation. Also when they're high functioning enough to not have grades that lead to seeing that something's arrived as well. But yes, related to the different types of ADHD, the mixed presentation of ADHD, including inattentive components and hyperactive, it is the more common, but it's still a considerable amount of people, about 30%, who have predominantly inattentive or hyperactive types. And basically, I talked about in that first week why it makes conceptual sense for them to be called the same thing. So when you look at the traits that exist for people with the hyperactive presentation or mixed presentation of ADHD, these might be like being more active tapping more, seeking novelty, potentially doing things fast to the point of making mistakes and stuff like that. So, some of those things actually will happen for people who have the inattentive presentation anyway. If you're doing something that's really mundane or there's a sense that it's not that valuable or worth your time and stuff like that, but you have to do it, there's a sense that you might rush it, inattentive not and then that'll lead to the higher rate of making mistakes. In the same vein, some of the characteristics that relate to the hyperactivity components, they're essentially acted-out components of what happens for people with just the inattentive component. So like, because they're required for external stimulation to focus on one thing the exclusion of all else is greater. For people with ADHD, when they're focusing on a conversation where somebody's, like speaking slowly or with a monotone kind of voice and stuff like that, then they're likely to have, say, another song in their head or something like that because they're trying to fulfil that requirement for external stimulation. The person with a hyperactive presentation may like tap and stuff like that, a bit more than somebody with the unit tentative presentation, but they're dealing with the same thing, right? They're dealing with this sense that I was like, I want to focus on this conversation, but that's only enough to take up 30% of my full focus. So I've got other stuff going on in my head at the same time. They could potentially act it out a bit more, but it's still that same kind of sense of needing extra stimulation to be able to focus on one thing to the exclusion of all else. And there are other things like that. So going back, viewing that part of the first week would give you a more detailed analysis of that by memory."

There's a video on my YouTube channel on addiction specifically, if you're interested really in that, but some things. So when you make things less convenient, the less convenient it is to do the thing that you attempted to do, the less self control it takes to not do it. Let's say I wanted to cut down drinking. And the difference between having to walk like there's a shop within 100 meters of my place that I could buy beer from, but that compared with having a beer sitting here, compared with having a beer in my fridge, compared with having a beer in my cupboard. So I'd have to put in the freezer for a beer to get cold. These are different levels of the degree of convenience that I have. And you want to start with the least comfort, and then as you become more confident and you become better at withstanding that temptation because you're out of the habit, then you can deal with more and more risky situations through situations that more lend themselves to temptation."

But if we just yield to it constantly, then we know that that pattern of behaviour leads to less and less ability to enact self-control over what we're doing. I think that given the way that you described kind of feeling that that's been the case long term, it's very, very difficult to enact self-control over anything when it comes to the moment. Certainly, if you very much feel that way, I would pick something extremely small, like small enough that you're like, of course, I'll get that done. But legitimately even though that may not be the bill and end-all goal that is going to change your life, any small thing that you retain over time is that little bit of proof that you don't have to be in the passenger seat just waiting for the motivation to come.

Oftentimes when people are struggling, they find themselves going to things and they're late because they were like, maybe set the alarm for like 2 hours before they got to leave the house. And that means that they don't have to get up at that second, but then there's not an alarm or a minder for the second they do have to get up. And I've done this myself as a psychologist, usually, you'll either kind of start really early so that you catch people before work, as well as a bit in the middle of the day or late. Right. So you're kind of catching either. So if I start late, that might be like 11:00 and finish at seven. And that means, like, I'm up way earlier than that. And then I'm like if I've got, say, 3 hours between the time that my alarm goes off and the time that I've got to be ready, then I'm much more likely in that case to actually convince myself that two minutes is enough time. Right? But if I think ahead of time, I know that I need 30 minutes to get ready and then I make sure that I've got an alarm for only 30 minutes. Even if I have one earlier, I've got that point where it'll remind me, take me out of what I'm doing. And I'll see that be like, okay, shit, I really have to get up now. Okay, good. That's often a really useful thing for people. Also, one other thing I just wanted to say, based on what you're saying, James, is it sounds like time management. Well, time management, but it sounds like with work you've got things that you do that are more like that are more mundane and things that you do that are more interesting. Now, I wonder whether it might be useful to kind of like break up and figure out to you what the most difficult things are to make yourself focus on because it's so easy to get caught up in, like thinking, well, the most complicated things that might be the most difficult for somebody without a headache. These must be the most difficult. So I'll plan those for the times that I'm like most, focused on most in the game. But oftentimes what I find is that these are the things that we can plan actually for times maybe towards the end of the day or something like that, where you're less onto it and you'll still actually do a good job with those complex tasks. But if you leave the mundane things till that time, which we would often do to try to give ourselves the ideal primary time to do the complex stuff, then we often just don't do those other tasks. So it can work to kind of mix that around and be like, what are the tasks I most struggle to actually get into and when should I place those? So I'm going to do them anyway."

So these are all options within that list of the possible things to interact with at that moment when we funnel that down. So this happens when we're Adrenalised or need to get focused and get something specifically done. We naturally give up our lateral thinking, our ability to think about things in different kinds of creative ways and stuff like that, temporarily in order to really funnel down and just get one thing done. And that happens when we have higher Norepinephrine, which happens to people with ADHD as well. We've all experienced it when there's an absolute emergency, when things are just kind of going crazy and you have to just kind of go for it and do it."

Did temporary things get in the way, and the experiment should just be rewritten? Sometimes that happens, right? I can think of a time that I was running this group in the past, and one client had the goal of he was going to university at the time. He wanted to get a bunch of his readings done, but out of the blue the following week, he had to take a trip to Canberra for a few days, which kind of blew the whole schedule out. So with that happening, it was unlikely that that goal would happen. That wasn't known at the time that he made the goal. He didn't fail at the goal. He just simply had to rejig it for a time that an unexpected, unlikely or any given week thing were to happen which makes it very difficult to do. Did you forget to complete the goal? Was it two grand? Was the goal not precise enough to be sure that you've done it or not? Did you get distracted, or was something else more interesting at the time? Okay, now before I go forward, let's go through and find out how everybody went with their goals, so maybe we should just, like, go in order kind of like last time.

But what you're saying about that sense of like really feeling in some way that you're unable to do it, it's an exciting point to kind of get through because when we think about it, it's like, well, of course, I'm physically capable of doing it. I understand that intellectually, but just how strong the feeling can be, that something that you haven't engaged with for a long time and maybe you wanted to engage with it or you wanted to get it done for a long time. So then there's been many moments that you've tried to rev yourself up and potentially not being able to. Or some people wait for themselves to get revved up hoping that that's going to happen spontaneously, but it often doesn't. But it's very much about that sense of capability, and I've noticed that myself. Like, when, say, I've had, like, a stack of GP letters to do, I've gotten through a bunch of them. I'm like, well, I've done a whole bunch of GP letters. It's not that hard a task in the sense that I don't think I'm going to be able to do it. But when I'm getting those things done, finally, after ages, there is a real sense of, like, shit, I can really do this, which is interesting to note because that shows that there was some doubt. And that's the thing that's often useful to address. Often when I'm working with people with ADHD, it's about like, how can we find those small wins over time that you can do something consistently no matter what? That is something. So there isn't that sense that when it comes to consistency, it won't be possible."

For example, a lot of people, like, if we take over something that should happen without some sort of aid and it's a specific external aid, then we will, over time, lose the ability to do it ourselves. That's one of the main reasons why people get really addicted to cannabis. Like, not so much that they're addicted in the same way as Opiates, that their whole body itches and feels terrible when they know it's more that they often smoke weed to go to sleep, to chill out at the end of the day. Kind of similar to what you're saying with alcohol, but then they become reliant on cannabis to get to sleep. So when they try not to have it, they probably don't sleep properly for maybe a solid week or something like that. And that's going to really increase the amount that they're going to want to get the weed. But the thing is, our natural body's response at the end of the day, to destress, to kind of do that auto regulation. So the process of self regulation is being taken over, I guess, by the sounds of it, by the drinking. Yeah. So it's just worth noting that, like, minimizing, crutches, minimizing anything that you don't need to need, but is always a good idea. But at the same time, there are plenty of times where I'll have a coffee, say, and I might have the idea, like, yep, this will wake me up. I'm still going to have days off sometimes without coffee. So it's also kind of proving to me that I can function without it. It's not required. But you still realize that it's a benefit for the reliance. Like, to have a benefit is one thing to have the reliance to the point that you give up other things or sacrifice, you recognize the importance of not using it."

So one, just because the morning is a part where we can absolutely have control, in a sense, when people. It is difficult to kind of pull themselves out of bed at that time. One way to do it is to turn off snooze on your phone and set your alarm somewhere where you can't physically reach you from the bed so that you are forced to get up to turn it off, where it's just going to keep on going, going because the snooze isn't there. Sometimes people are like, well, if they just turn it off and then go back to bed, which often just works anyway. But if they find that they go back to bed, then another way is, like, they might put the clothes on that they want to throw on in the morning, like underneath their phone, so that they pick up their phone and their clothes are right there ready to go. Another way is like so waking up in the morning and getting rid of that kind of melatonin so that you're not feeling sleepy like you go back to sleep again. That only takes being physically active to the point of walking fast with intent to the bathroom and going to the bathroom and walking fast back, as opposed to stumbling into the bathroom as we might do in the middle of the night. That act of intentional coordination will wake us up in some way, like hyperventilating, is another one where people really find it difficult to get out of bed, particularly in the winter. They can, like, literally just like, sit up in bed or even lay down in bed if you hyperventilate, like, really for like 20 seconds, guarantee you won't want to go back to sleep. So there are different ways to kind of hack it like that. Another way would be like, once you've, like, you know, you've gotten up to grab your phone, you might be like, well, I'm not willing to, like, fully decided to get up. But it's like, well, am I willing to fully decide to just go to the bathroom and then I'll decide whether I go back to bed or do the other thing? The more little things that we have in between, the less likely we're going to want to go back to sleep. So that's the morning side, and there are just techniques around there. And then I'd suggest at night time just having a novelty cut off so you don't have to worry so much about, am I asleep yet? Am I asleep? That's something that this is going to contribute to. But you don't have to be checking in so quickly because it's just like, you have that novelty cut off. I would suggest half an hour before the time at which you want to get to sleep, so about the time at which you want to go to bed. So about 10:00 p.m. And that just means, like if you watch TV or read a book or listen to an audiobook or anything like that, that you would do it with something that you've already read or seen or whatever. So that in a sense, sleepiness comes in waves. So there's this tiredness or fatigue that occurs depending on what we do throughout the day. But we can be tired and not get sleepy to the point that we can sleep. That sense that you're like, yeah, I could go to sleep at this moment that comes in waves. So if we are, say, watching something that we want to finish, or we're reading a book, and we want to know what happens at the end of the chapter, if we, like, get sleepy and then we finish that section, we're likely not to be sleepy by the time the next section is finished. So then we've got to wait for the next wave in a sense, which is about 30 minutes to 60 minutes, depending on the person and how tired they are, the period of these. So the novelty cut-off is primarily so you've got something you're willing to stop at any time, right? So no matter what that is, that's the primary thing. So just cutting off the novelty and working in the morning will make it so much easier to make this shift in the future without taking on every single island."

More likely to get some stuff done because there's a sense of having started it ripped off that bandaid, making sure that you have reminders and everything like that, that you've planned out and made sure that you reasonably have enough time to do everything that you need to do. This is really crucial as well. Starting is its own task as well. So open the documents, put in the title, paste details and into the form structure, then chill and work on it when you're ready because that is a separate task that doesn't have to be combined with the whole task. So you can just get that one done at a different point and therefore more quickly because it's just a tiny amount of stuff. Bonus tip for writing give yourself permission to write garbage. For anyone who wants to write their best, who has a tendency to have high standards about their writing, it can lead to a lot of procrastination kind of looking at the blank page and thinking well, there's no way to the blank page, in a sense is perfect and it's never going to be perfect after that."

If people had scarce resources and not everybody may get fed at that time, and potentially there's danger. Like, you've got to you know, if you hear a loud noise, you've got to react to it because that might actually be something seriously dangerous. Those types of situations where you have to be highly strong or competitive with other people lead to low serotonin. And people with low serotonin are they feel less connected, more individualistic. They tend to be more competitive. They tend to be successful because of the competitiveness, all else being equal, compared with people who are really naturally high in serotonin. People who are really high in serotonin are like perfect neighbors, really kind, lovely, empathetic people, but they tend not to have a crazy amount of kind of unnecessary job success, one could put it, because they don't really mind. They could be more competitive. They're not trying to get themselves ahead of another person because the sense is we've got enough for everyone. So you need resource, fruitful environment."

It's definitely partly that thing of being drawn to people because of interest and stuff but certainly, when it comes to primary relationships, it's not always the case.

They found somebody who was basically the polar opposite to them because they had traits that they admired, because they were the opposite reflection of what they were ashamed of not possessing. They were with this person who also valued those traits and they did what they could early in the relationship to make up for these challenges. But naturally, it's going to show itself at some point. So then it just led to higher and higher shame about what was going on. How do you work back up to having a good relationship with somebody who I'm like? It's a challenging conversation to have with a client because what do you pick her if it wasn't based on shame? And is it the right partner for him? Of course, that's not a useful conversation to have when you got three kids together necessarily."

It's not all negative reasons for which we decide to take on extra things and stuff like that. Sometimes it's worth noting, like, what are the various reasons? Which ones do I care about, and which ones don't? I can think of a client who I'm working with who has ADHD, and she's always been, like, the social hub for a friend's kind of thing. Like, even though she has three kids and a husband now and stuff like that, she still, like, always is the person who organizes stuff for her friends and stuff like that. And, I mean, we've identified that part of it is that kind of like, this is her role, her value in the group. That was part of it, what we've been talking about today. But there's still that positive side of, like, well, I really like, when I've got that momentum and stuff, I don't want it to completely phase out. So it's a matter of looking at when is it a good time. How much is it a good time? So for her, given them working with her individually so there's more time. We're going through overall values that she has for how she wants to live her life and what she cares about and then kind of figuring out how much time she's got and then figuring out what are the things. Which are really meaningful and important to keep on doing and which ones are less important so that she's not throwing the baby out with bath water as well.

The walk point is one that I really struggle with because I used to do group exercises, and I loved it mentally. That was really good for me mentally. Then it wasn't good for my hormones and my adrenals at all. Kind of added all that contributed to the burnout. In regard to that. People always tell me to just go for a walk.

First, I'll just go over this section and I think that this is a bit of revision. The fact that lower tension rest is important because attention is a limited resource. Like, I was talking about this area of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It takes a lot of resources to run that. And when we are resource depleted or we're not getting enough resources or we're not getting a lot of resources to our brain, that's going to be one of the first areas that then don't get as much. So it completely makes sense that when you've got something, whether the model for self-control, the model for using that part of the brain is the strength model. And it is because they're both highly resource-intensive areas that are only going to be built up if we're actually using them to the extent that we're barely being able to make it work based on what we have. So we have to be like delaying gratification or deciding to do things that we don't want to do and stuff like that. Every time we administer that will over ourselves. Basically, the difference between what we would like to have done and what we would like to do. The gap between those two things is self-control. It's also useful to point out that so using a technique like getting yourself fascinated with something and therefore kind of hyper-focusing on it, tends not to take as much mental effort and stuff like that in a sense per time that you're doing it, you're doing it for 12 hours. That's going to take a bit of mental effort, but it doesn't take as much mental effort in a sense to do those things because where was I? Sorry, I lost my train of thought there. To do those things. I forgot what those things were."

I imagine that if you hadn't set the goal at all, you probably would have done it the way that you did it the week before, and then there is a massive reduction. And I was a little apprehensive about the goal size when you said it last week because I was like, right, that's every single day. That would often be one that would be quite hard to jump into. You've been able to then not only build yourself control, because any delay, gratification, any holding back, even if we end up yielding to the impulse, ultimately that time that we are delaying it in any way is utilising self-control, is building up the connections, the size of the brain regarding the dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex. So even if you ultimately end up going and eating that junk food, you want or playing that game or whatever it is, you're still getting closer in terms of that ability. It's kind of like if you go to the gym and you're trying to lift a weight that's like just a bit beyond you, and you don't injure yourself, but you're really pushing hard. While that's not the most effective way to build muscle versus having the full range of motion, you will get stronger. Right? And if you keep on, if you kept on persisting at that one weight, eventually you're going to get strong enough to lift it as long as it's within our capacity to do so. And that's exactly the same. It's use it or lose it because our muscles require a lot of resources to get stronger. So it's not going just to be maximised all the time. It doesn't make any sense. And then the same with that area of the brain in particular. So there was absolutely like that's going to. Build you toward it as well as going from eight to three-quarters of an hour and therefore having a massive reduction based on otherwise not completing that goal. So just kind of keeping those things in mind and to realise, okay, if going from 8 hours, roughly speaking down to zero was like that's, 100% of your goal, then to go down to three-quarters of an hour, then you have still achieved 90% of your goal. A little bit more. This stuff is always keeping in mind if you were just to continue with that, as you rejigged it a little bit, you're like, okay, maybe every single day was a bit much. Or also what you realise is the function like we were talking about last time regarding the functional analysis, like some other function that it has fulfilled. Well, you know that the days that you went home when you were stressed from work or like you had an overwhelming day or something like that, you were more likely to want to jump into it. Well, that says the function must be related to that sense of stress. So it could be like it's recharging or escape or something like that. Once you've figured out what that is, then you can start doing something else that fulfils that function in a better way. Then you're going to be much more likely to retain that goal over time because you won't have that pullback to it of fulfilling the function that still needs actually to be fulfilled."

Like we're talking about, like I talked about a bit last time planning is itself a task. Ideally, we want to separate it from the overall task. And this is part of that kind of breaking things up into smaller pieces like somebody mentioned earlier. And it's about like instead of having that part where we're most likely to get distracted or flounder the setting up part as a part of the whole big task, we can have that as a really kind of small thing that can be done with adrenaline and quickly the day before or something like that. So then it becomes a much smaller task. And when you sit down to do the overall thing the parts are already set up and we're less likely to flounder or get distracted. Rake the importance of what you have to do and note that urgency is not the same as importance. And it can feel like that sometimes. So urgency, the sense that no matter how important something is, and that could be pretty flimsily important, like looking at a notification on your phone, but there's a sense of urgency because it popped up at that moment. You don't know if it's important. And it's very easy to conflate the two where we kind of get caught into like, oh, this is urgent, I've got to do this second. And then conflate that with importance and jump into that potentially over something that is more important. But ultimately the way that I kind of look at importance is, to consider yourself at the end of the day or end of the week, looking back, what would you feel best about having done? And the answer to that will be the things that are most important to you. So then if you kind of ask yourself that question about these things that might seem urgent, how good will I feel about getting that done? Versus other things that should give us an idea about how important something is to us versus how versus the urgency. Because the urgency doesn't matter a damn. If it's not that important, it can seem like it. So is the new thing the most important thing? And if not, do it after the most important things. Does the new thing stop you from doing important things? If so, don't take it on. Easier said than done, of course; effectively limiting what you take on. Because it's in that moment that you've got to spot it and you don't necessarily know when you're going to have your time or resources requested of you. So sometimes you might be able to control, like when that time comes where you've got a request for your time, like you could check in to see whether somebody needs something, noting that, okay, you're going to apply this technique. So then that's a way to apply it without having to train it to the point that you're going to naturally apply it at the moment and then start to build up that strategy if that makes sense. Because the more that you can do it in any way, the more that you've practised it, that it becomes a normal thing that you do to think ahead in this way and to determine the importance of urgency and stuff, the more that you're likely to do it when the situation presents. And it's only after practising it a bit and getting used to that sense and seeing firsthand that it's actually useful and a good idea. It's only after that that you're likely to apply in those moments where there's an unpredictable request for your time or resources, which is often what it is. Consider your current load, like I was talking about, and then consider the importance of new things versus the other things I was talking about as well. So let's just chill and does anybody have any questions about any of those things? Rather explain it really well or really badly really well because you all just perfectly get it and don't have any questions."

Romanticism? I'm like, yeah, sure, sounds good. I'll make a thorough PowerPoint. And then I guess the point where I plan some time, I think it'll take like an hour or so and then I'm like, maybe this will take longer. And then I realized like at least 3 hours and then I've only given myself an hour to do it. I don't know how to yeah, no."

But I want to make the distinction between trance or the experience of time at the moment versus our ability to potentially learn how long things take retrospectively or looking forward. So people with the awareness of time, the awareness of the flow of time and how long things take, very much is determined by checking in and having that sense of like, well, I've checked in at this time. There's some sense that roughly a certain amount of time has passed and then I check in again, that kind of thing. So that requires having some degree of your attention left over to do that kind of checking in. When people with ADHD are really intently hyper-focusing, they're not going to do as much of that kind of checking in because they're going to be fully immersed and at that time they experience what we call trance, where we feel like something takes less time than it did. So that's the experience in the moment and that's part of what leads to this sense of time blindness. But another big part of it is also like that it's the lack of planning. And it's worth noting that this kind of sense of how long is a certain task going to take? This is not beyond people with ADHD. It just means being intentional about it. Right. Because there is that time blindness just looking back in your memory and being like, how long did that task feel like it took? That's likely to be inaccurate, but if you actually note, alright, so I think X task is going to take me so long like you estimate what it is going to take you 2 hours and then, you know, I saw it this time, then it took me this long. And we repetitively get that information even if we're not deliberately noting it down in a way that we can come back to that experience over time will calibrate our sense of how long things are going to take. But it does mean intentionally kind of doing that. But noteworthy, it's not something that like by doing these things that you've got to do in order to take advantage of it anyway, you would be enacting that process that would improve your ability to determine how long things will take."

Yeah, I wouldn't say that any neurotransmitter itself is primarily drive related, but yes, serotonin is certainly heavily related to drive, where people take the medications that are used to alter serotonin levels specifically. So these are called SSRIs. They're the primary one that's used SSRI standing for selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitor. I can get into the reason why it's called a reuptake inhibitor, but the main thing is that it doesn't create extra serotonin, but it moves it around more. So we're using more of what's there. And when that happens, people tend to not experience their stress. Resilience goes up. They're not as bothered by things. Their sleep goes like, people have higher dream recall, deeper sleep and stuff like that. When they have higher serotonin, so their sleep often improves as well. They notice that things don't make them as mad and stuff like that, in the sense of being able to emotionally feel things and express yourself rather than having just like do you know what I mean? Like not having a reactive face or something like that. People are more emotionally engaging when generally speaking, when they're on the higher side of serotonin. You can manipulate that. When you think of anyone, we won't necessarily discuss it, but for anyone who has experimented with recreational drugs such as psychedelics, like LSD acid as its street name, or psilocybin in mushrooms, and all of the primary psychedelics that are named so are serotonin mimickers. So they are similar enough in part to the molecular structure of serotonin that some so a subset of the serotonin receptor sites will bind to that as though it's serotonin. And so the effect that people have when they take these things, they tend to be the threshold for seeing a connection between two things is lowered. But that can be so low that you see a connection when it's not there. So that can be problematic regarding over-certainty, but it can be like you're spotting references everywhere. You're feeling famous, Steve Jobs talks about taking microdoses of, I think it was LSD, either psilocybin, but one of those, and I think it was LSD, to intentionally reduce that threshold a bit so that he would, like, explore an idea and then to kind of check whether that idea worked still when he's sober. But the whole idea was that he notices things that he wouldn't necessarily notice or connect together when he's taken that, just as an idea of the subjective experience of it.

But once I've done it a few times so that the association is like after I've done the brush my teeth or shower or whatever, I naturally like, oh, there's something else I do after that. And then that reminds me to do it. That makes it easier overall to set up multiple goals because they build on one another. You don't need that. In the course of no reminders or anything like that or no associations to remember it is much harder. Before the next session, if you've modified your goal, try again. So important. And if you just need to keep it, keep at it because things got in the way this time, try again. If you completed your goal, consider if you should stick to it at this level for a bit, or if you feel like that was a sold level and you could move higher, then you could try increasing it. Just note if you do increase your goal and then you find that you don't achieve all of it the following week, then that's just a note that you've probably moved on a bit prematurely, which is fine. It doesn't mean that you're incapable of the goal; it just means that you must take it a bit slower. All right. That was tons of content because it was two weeks in a row. How's everybody going?

I can get cast to send out an email to everyone, and maybe I can get a numbered list of names, and then maybe, if you like, highlight or circle or whatever it is and send back that email.

There's evidence very clearly showing that if somebody stops completely cold turkey, their chances of success in eradicating the habit are far higher than if they try to reduce it. And in many cases, when people are very tempted into whatever behaviour it is, they very well might. Not be able to do it the other way. Like often times I used to work at an addiction clinic, as a psychologist up in Queensland Sunshine Coast. And like, people come in, particularly with alcohol, they'd be like, you know, I don't want to be like a nondrinker, I want to just cut it down. I'd be like, okay, fair enough. And I'd tell them about the stats to do with I think it's two or three times more likely the people are when they stop at Cold Turkey. I'd have to recheck that. But I'd go through this and I'd be like, how about we do it as an experiment where like we try for say, two weeks or X amount of time to see whether you can just cut down. And if you're not able to, perhaps we can talk then about completely reducing just because they tend to like, if somebody is able to cut down, and I can generally see that if they're not like that kind of, you know, controlled by the habit, then they will be able to, but generally speaking, they won't be able to. So we'll end up jumping into that. And the reason for it is having a bit of it like having let's say if it's an alcohol having like, you open a beer or you have one beer or two beers, whatever, that creates a risky scenario where you're far more likely to have more in the same with the game.

Like I've wasted hours on TikTok. It's embarrassing how many hours have wasted on there. And I feel like it's really hard to be a person with ADHD in a world where everything is designed to suck us in the way it does. And it's really annoying knowing that as well, being aware of that but not being able, feeling like there's nothing I can do about it. I find it really hard to just not do those things because I know all of this."

        "value": "It's worth noting that it's not just people who have ADHD who are prey to this either. It can be gotten through and sometimes it might be as much as anything the decision to make a compromise like not having the app on your phone so that you've got to use a browser or you can even there's another plugin, I can't remember the name of it, but that I've used in the past. Whatever website you put into it, it bounces from that website to something else and I had it, so it jumped to a video of a YouTube video of why it's a bad idea to do that, to remind myself. So it's kind of like if I jumped in there at a moment of forgetting then I'd be like, oh yeah, that's why I had that. But oftentimes it's kind of choosing. But it's worth noting that it's more than just your attention span that is impacted over time by spending a lot of time scanning on social networking oftentimes. Like the significant thing that happens in a lot of ways is that you normalize to hyper normal stimuli. So like you think of the amount of novelty you have in the world with the people you see or attractiveness or whatever it is, whatever it is that we're kind of we're looking for out in the world, the amount that we see all at once, all quickly, it's so much greater than the actual thing could be. You think of like a classic example is there's sex where you have to be, you know, you have to find some book but then there's pornography, right? The novelty, the access and all that kind of stuff. Once you get habituated to that, they will often lose their interest for sex. They lose their interest\u2014that drive for many things. And in the same vein with social networking and stuff, people will often find that. I've had people primarily come to me in what they describe before we realize that the issue is like scrolling their social media too much is that they're like, you know, sometimes I just feel like bored, but like I should be doing something but there's nothing I want to do, nothing's interesting. That's the feeling that people get when they don't allow themselves to actually be bored because they're constantly filling that with something. Like the way that I put it is that the feeling of boredom is like the feeling of hunger where it's not pleasant, but it's also essential. After you haven't eaten for a while, you feel hungry and that'll make you go out and seek some food that you need some nutrients. But you can get rid of that hunger signal by eating white bread and margarine. And that'll keep you going for a while as you're getting depleted of everything else, but it's not going to keep you going very well. Right? And to me, like just constantly filling every moment we have with something just because we can't stand not having anything, it's just white bread and margarine. It takes away our drive to actually go out and seek something interesting. And when I get people to actually just pull back to the extent that they've got a bit of time where they're just allowing their mind to wonder that they feel more inspired, they feel more creative, they're more likely to spontaneously have ideas that they're interested in pursuing. And there's even research showing that people's creativity improves to the point that they actually even perform better. When it comes to a lateral thinking based task, one example would be like, here's a paper cup. How many things can you think of in two minutes to do with it? So it's like innovatively thinking of ways that you can utilize something. This is the lateral thinking task. People do better at that task when they've allowed themselves to be bored. They do worse when they're constantly filling up all their stimulus."

So this is for stuff that you just have to do that's inherently not going to be interesting. So it doesn't lend itself to that hyperfocused side. You could use the pomodoro technique but it may not even take that long. Like for example, there's a good HowTo ADHD. So HowTo ADHD is a popular YouTube channel that you may have come across like a youngish like late 20s girl who has ADHD who does some really good videos about the different aspects of it. But anyway, so she was talking about her and her partner, who both have ADHD with dishes in their house, given they live together, so they both have a poster with their names on it. And when they do the dishes, they get to move their name further away. And the name that's closest to it determines the person who next has to wash it. And even though, like, you know, you washed it and that means that the next person has to do it next and all that kind of stuff, being able to move, that makes it feel real enough that there's a reward directly after doing the dishes. And it makes the overall task less aversive and easier to motivate yourself to do over time. And the same with using particular rewards and stuff like that. Stickers healthy treats or other treats in moderation. Race yourself a housemate or a friend, and find some ways to gamify it. But I just want to be clear with the things that we choose. Many people, particularly those who beat themselves up about procrastinating and not getting focused when they want to and stuff like that, will have a self-punishment angle where it's like, well, I'm going to stay inside. All day unless I get this done or I'm going to and basically using things that you need regularly, like socializing and fun and physical activity and stuff like that, as the reward and not doing them. And I absolutely don't suggest that there are some things like those that are necessary for our productivity over time and should not be sacrificed. But like say, for example, that you were doing some homework or something like that and you had some friends or you were doing some work, some work from your work, and you're doing it from home, whatever it is. But you've got some friends who want to meet you for lunch at a cafe or something like that. You could decide, alright, so I'm definitely going to do that because I can fit it in as possible. That's an excellent opportunity to socialise it'll break up my day. Sweet. That's definite. What can I reward myself with though? That can be like you get a standard latte or you get like, you know, your caramel mocker crazy, whatever it is. It's something that is peripheral and unnecessary but it's a nice little you only get if you do the thing. It's essential not to use something that you essentially need over time as a reward and, therefore, that you don't get it\u2014reminders and Planning is a task, too and is often overlooked. Decide what must be done. Even like the day before, it can be helpful to spend five to ten minutes a day before you want to get some stuff done that's mainly not fun or that you've been avoiding or something like that because it's such a small amount of time and it's not associated with doing the whole task."

But it's like a defensive layer because it could be the case at any time. Then I'm going to be much more sensitive and want to defend myself and convince a person, even get them to admit that they were wrong about the criticisms. So therefore I could be okay and believe that I didn't deserve those criticisms, that I wasn't incapable in the way that I thought that that suggested. That makes sense. And there are other ones related to different areas, but we'll get there in that week. All right, guys, we've got a bit of time. Let's get a couple of people to say what's the most mundane thing that you have to do on a regular basis? Either for work or life admin or something like that? Like for me in my job, for example, because people usually have things, parts of their job they're like pretty conducive to ADHD. They work well for them. So for me it's like this presenting or being in front of somebody one to one and having a conversation, there's enough accountability to pull me in, there's enough desire to do well so that I can help someone. But then I'm writing a letter to a GP. If I were a betting man, maybe 10% of red and that's hard to convince myself to do versus send someone a letter and then I get one back and there's a conversation for you guys. What are the things that are hardest or the thing that's hardest to motivate yourself to do on a regular basis?"

There are things that would be particularly hard for people with ADHD like doing a PhD because it's such a long drawn out thing that you have to self monitor a great deal but I have come across people with PhDs with ADHD all the power to them. Certain situations are going to be more accessible for people with ADHD or not, but we definitely shouldn't stop ourselves from trying things like that. To me, it is a valuable construct to understand ourselves a bit better and to realise that we're not alone in this world where it's only 1% of people or something like that. So it's worth having a label so that you can spot them because people with ADHD are entertaining to chat with."

And then, so with that, they're like, oh, he's getting bored with this material. We'll give him more material that's like higher up. And it's like that's precisely perfect for somebody with ADHD. Right. So that thing worked out really well until I got to whatever grade and I'd read all the books, and then I started getting less interested in schooling.

Whether we've got the same triggers or different triggers, but the volatileness, there is something that I see a therapist for my shoes with my daughter cause I want it to be excellent. But it's hard because she's got a lot of triggers now trigger her. She's a teenage girl; I get it. But I don't know, I just wonder whether there's an opportunity where there's a similar issue with the conflict is just something that's of interest as well, rather than something that's something to be avoided or don't need it. Some accomplishments with somebody actually is like I'll take this in grace and it could just be a misheard, it could be really nothing. What are you doing today? What are you doing? It's a simple question, but we've heard it, and I feel like it's a defensive thing. That's just an example."

So earlier on in what you were saying no, no, but I still give a bit of description now. But earlier on what you were saying about handling temper and stuff like that, where that may be a challenge, but also then you're talking about sensitivities to particular things. Now it's worth noting that with those kind of sensitivities I found that my guess would be that it's not characteristic of ADHD because I see people who clearly don't possess that at all, although it's very common. But if you think about the experiences that are likely, that are likely for people with ADHD to experience, then the characteristics of ADHD in this society are likely to lead to the traumas that make those sensitivities. So and I talk about the particular areas and more specifically in week nine, but the most common one to see, and I see it in the majority of people with ADHD that I come across, so this would be a sensitivity around the possibility of failure. So because of that experience of being told that the fluctuating application of your ability early in school is actually because you're lazy or because you're not interested in stuff like that, and then either holding on to the idea that you're lazy because it's not incapable, but then still having in the back of your mind that it's actually due to an incapability because you have really tried. You're still being told that so in some way you're not meeting the Mark. And then because it wasn't predictable and you couldn't rectify it, there's a sense of inevitability there because when you can't predict it, you can't predict the absence of it either. So then you're kind of like always expecting and waiting for this thing. And when we consider something like that more likely, and it's foundationally hard to deal with because we do care about our capability for various reasons, that it increases the size of the threat in a sense. And the bigger the threat in any situation, the more we must defend ourselves. If there's a physical threat, like somebody is picking a fight, but I don't know, a child is picking a fight with you or something like that, you don't have to get all revved up and get prepared to fight back. But if it's somebody like a huge seven-foot guy, then different story, just as kind of putting it down to the physical it's the most way, but it's the same thing, right? Like if somebody gives me criticism, the idea is, and I don't have that sense, that I'm inevitably going to fail, I don't believe that, then I'm like, okay, so I've got that criticism, what can I do with that?"

Oftentimes the things that are more difficult aren't actually more complex or more difficult in that sense, more challenging aren't actually the most difficult things to get done because they're interesting. They pull your attention in. It's those admin things that and oftentimes it's shuffling around people's day so that people will often intuitively be like, right, I need to place the things that are most complex at the time that I'm most focused, so I can do a good job with those tasks. And for neurotypical people, that works pretty well. With ADHD, we should generally schedule tasks that are mundane and boring for the times that we're most focused. And, like, toward the end of the day, potentially, we may still very well get focused on those things that are more complex because they're more interesting. It actually doesn't take as much effort and in a sense, like a push to do the things that are more challenging if they're more interesting. So maybe for you, it could be like looking at the structure of your day, looking at the times when you do those, and then picking, you know, some amount of days. It could be two days or something like that that you're like, Right, I'm going to try this strategy, and I'm going to compare it to the other days and see whether it works better. It will, because I've done this before, but it will. But that's one idea. But the strategy was to pick the things that are most complicated but may be more interesting and to make a distinction between things that are more mundane and not interesting. The things like most mundane and not interesting things, they're the things that you want to place into the times that you're most revved up and able to focus on anything. So that might be like just when the medication is most kicked in. It could be for some people it's particular hours of the day that they'll find their most focused, all that kind of stuff."

And the other one is high functioning.

But certainly when it comes to the experiences that people have who have ADHD, which we went over a bit in that first session, are likely then to lead to some of these traumas that can be handled in various ways, including potentially people pleasing or underlenting standards. I talked about the one where people with ADHD will be able to focus well on days when the content is genuinely interesting early in school and not so well when it's not. So there will be fluctuations from day to day. So then the level that you're expected to be your abilities here and then it's not always happening and sometimes you're not heading in your work and stuff like that, that can often lead to being called lazy or saying that you've got a potential that's unmet and stuff like that. And through that experience, because you know underneath it all that you are trying and then you're trying and being told that you're coming up short, that's the experience of failure over time. And that can lead because it's overtime and potentially feels unpredictable, that it can give you the sense that you're walking on eggshells, that it could happen at any time, so it's inevitable. And once you think that was like, how do I make up for this thing? If I think that there's this thing that's about me that people tend to look down on me for or whatever it is, I better do something to make up for that. And so that's one thing that's very common. Another is because the prefrontal cortex of people with ADHD, although it catches up in almost every aspect, by the time people with ADHD are adults, there is a delay in the development of the prefrontal cortex that can be really present around mid to late primary school and potentially lead to bullying. Because there's a one to two-year difference in the ability to understand social nuance. So that can lead to some bullying as well. That can lead to a sense of rejection, which then could be then taken care of by a person in a similar way of the unrelenting standards of people pleading. So for reasons like that, because experiences like that are more common. The things that people do to try to shore themselves up, regardless of those, are more common for people with ADHD."

Because at that time, that's when you're adrenalized, that's when you have access to Norepinephrine. And creating that last-minute effect can be done by, like, setting up, say, if you've got a friend you do an edit for every now and then. They do an edit of something you've written every now and then, setting up a time and saying, all right, can I send you my paper tomorrow? So then you've got an idea, like you want to do as much as you can so it's as helpful as possible before you actually send it to them. Or if you were doing a PhD and you had a supervisor to set up a nonnegotiable deadline that you see in a certain amount so you could decide and set a date with your supervisor if that was a situation. For example, to actually have dates where you have the intro, the method, the conclusion, that kind of thing, you're piecemealing it a bit so you don't just get such a massive unsupervised set of work. So non negotiable deadlines, pomodoro and getting revved up. And also it's worth noting that exercise I may have mentioned in the past, about 30 minutes of high intensive cardio exercise, leads to a two hour window in which people with ADHD have up regulated their Norepinephrine endopley into such a degree that it doesn't actually differ, all else being equal to the average person. So, very, very handy to do exercise in the morning before you want to get going and focus. And what I've found as well, particularly because sleep is often an issue for people with ADHD, is that more exercise than the average person is required to get the most out of it. Like most people, they can get good sleep and stuff like that with, say, this amount of exercise. But doing more for people with ADHD still continues to have a positive effect in my experience, and a really beneficial one in terms of being less inclined to do those, to get in that mode where you feel bored, where you feel like nothing's really that interesting, to lose momentum with things. And also, particularly if it's in the morning, like I said, the ability to adrenalize and feel good about accomplishments throughout the day to some degree."

We'll talk about reviewing reasons why you might not have been perfect with your goals because it's not about being impractical or about pretending that you have done better than we have. It's just simply being fair to ourselves and being realistic about how much has been accomplished so that we have a point to move from. As soon as we kind of jump into beating ourselves up about what we haven't done and whatnot, actually, it stops us from jumping in and thinking about the logical reasons for which we might not have done it. Because we kind of get caught into that negative thought pattern of like, this is my fault, blah blah blah. This is incongruent with thinking about that fair idea of the different things that might have come up that may not come up in the future, that could be changed around and everything like that. And oftentimes, we jump to the assumption that if we haven't completed our goal that it's due to some lack of performance, but oftentimes it is a lack of kind of sorting out some aspect of the organisation of it so that we've got the reminders, we've got the time and everything like that. Because we can so easily just need to refine it a little bit the next time, but we're not going to be able to see the woods through the trees kind of and be able to see how we can shape it up going into the future. And also to not have an aversive experience, right? To have a nice positive experience through having the goals. Because it leads to betterment rather than being like, well, I thought I was going to fail and then, to my perception, I did. It's all about kind of reshaping that a bit. We'll talk about how to deal with a whole bunch of goals that you have in life, as most of us do have many things, perhaps at any given time that we would like to change or we would like to do differently or better. But it is really important to note that if we try to do all of these things at once, then we're just trying to do too many novel things that we've got to directly pay attention to build up as new habits all at once and we're doubtful to be able to do that. I frame it up as trying to learn to ride a bike at the same time as learning to ride without no hands. It's like, well, let's learn how to ride first, get the feeling of the balance and then we can throw in something extra once. A lot of it is quite routine because you think about somebody when they're doing something like that. They're learning how to ride a bike. Or you think about when you have learnt something that you don't have muscle memory for and the amount of little things you've got to think about consciously. Like, I've got to, like while I kind of push down here, I've got to be leaning this way and like all the little things that absolutely require no attention down the track. And I mean, because of that, we're very limited in the amount of extra stuff we can take on, especially once you factor in lifestyle and everything else you've got to do. So these are like potentially new things that you're stacking on top of potentially an abundance of other things that you do all the time, and then we're creating a situation that is very likely to lead to what we perceive as a failure and therefore give us the sense that we're not able to achieve consistency over time. And like I mentioned in the past, particularly in my experience working with people with ADHD, and it's been something true for myself as well, that sometimes the most important thing to do first is just to have any small goal that you can do consistently, patiently, over the course of weeks to prove to yourself that something can be completely under your control in terms of the time that you do it, the way that you do it, and everything like that. So there isn't that sense that when you're focused, your output is dictated by spontaneous bouts of motivation rather than your control over it. And that's not to say that we want to have that direct decidedness for everything we do; it's just that it's possible. So therefore, when things really matter, then we do it for that but then it's also the recognition that we don't have enough time, we don't have enough resources to do that for everything, no one does. So then it's that kind of bargaining of, \" okay, I'll apply it here, and you're divvying up your resources. You have a certain amount of eggs, and you've got a bunch of baskets and are figuring out which ones to fill up a bit. This is your time, your effort, your energy in the course of a day and everything like that, to place it into those baskets, those areas, the goals in this case that are most important to you. At the time or that is going to build up and give you that sense of accomplishment that will ultimately lead to a better situation down the line in the way that you particularly value rebuilding routines when life happens and they just fall apart. I don't think any, well, no conversation about reviewing goals and everything like that would be complete without just recognising that these goals are made in the context of all the other things that we're doing in life. Sometimes things get shaken up. Sometimes, no matter how hardened and set a routine is, there will be temporary stages where we cannot enact those for whatever reason. And sometimes we're just going to be under a great deal more stress than others, and that can lead to some or perhaps several of these routines that we may have set up over time to fall apart to some degree, right? Whether that's just a reduction from where you were at or whether that's kind of losing momentum and feeling that way. The thing is that anytime that we've developed a goal at any stage, we can rejig it, and we can reinstate it at a stage in the future much more easily, of course, than the first time. And suppose the idea is that having things fall apart is occasionally a failure. In that case, that definition leads to the majority of people being a failure in that way because that is a normal part of life, and we need to see that as such. Alright, any questions about any of that? Any comments? Anything that you guys wanted to say before we crack forward a little bit? Actually, maybe we could. I'll just see what the next slide is. Yeah, perfect. Perhaps after that next slide, we can talk about people's individual goals, but no questions or quandary queries about any of that stuff. Alright, first short Pomodoro set. So, reviewing goals. This is a curious mind. So I just want you to think about the goals. Actually, we'll do it in this order. Let's actually go through everyone's goals, and then we'll apply them as we go forth. I forgot to do the slides from last time. Should I do that at the end, or should I do that right now?"

I got near tentative type, so I was in a bit of a spacecraft, diagnosed very early. Luckily my mum was a psychologist and spotted it straight away because she has it and that whole side of the family has it, although they're all hyperactive and I'm incentive. Yeah. So I've gone on and off medication throughout my life. Generally used it in high school through like the HSC and cramming it all into one sort of period, all the study and stress and then same with uni as well and didn't take it day to day and then after that work for a bit unmedicated. And that was a bit of a disaster, mainly because I found out I didn't like the field that I graduated into. And then later in life, I through most of my 20s wasn't medicated and traveled overseas with overseas, came back and hopped back on it and sort of cycled between decent Featherman and riddling because I could use one for about six months or a year and it would lose efficacy. And then I switch to the other. And then I got a new psychiatrist who put me on by advance and it's been amazing and I've been on it for about four years now and I haven't had to change the dose or anything and it just works perfectly. So really happy about that. Obviously it's been like a lifesaver for me because I've been suffering for some gut issues for the last three and a half years, which affects my mood and concentration and I didn't have the drive and I would have lost my job a long time ago. There would have just been no way I could do Admin stuff boring day to day without it. The reason I joined the group is that I think tried to be at times proactive with learning more about ADHD. And I think, yeah, I would really like to learn like, the practical strategies to help manage it. I got a few friends with ADHD as well and just meeting other people with the condition because it is rare just in general life, it's not super common. Just to hear people going through the same things as you do, you have done and do is massively validating. Like, one of my best mates have ADHD and talking about like, rejection, dysphoria and all the bits and pieces that come with ADHD is just pretty like something's completely wrong with you. So, yeah, that's kind of why I joined today and I was actually kind of looking for a psychologist with ADHD experience. Unfortunately, I got an ADHD coach and he wasn't great. And then I got an ADHD psychologist and she had ADHD. She wasn't great either, which is pretty disappointing. Yeah, I guess I'm just here to really try and learn that there's some practical strategies that I just kind of a bit more than the basic stuff as well."

The experience that you talked about, by the way, regarding the medication and the tolerance over time, it's not everybody who struggles with that, but I definitely it's reasonably common. And I've experienced that myself, where I realized early on in the piece with my psychiatrist that tolerance was just occurring too quickly. And so the solution that we came up with was to make sure I had at least one day off a week, for example. So some people manage it by intentionally keeping it down and having some degree of the effect. Some can get a benefit as you did by switching to the long-acting form, and then others will, like, take a day off and stuff like that. I mentioned it in a case that relates to anybody else who might not have figured it out yet for themselves."

Sometimes I'll get people coming individually who have ADHD, and one of the issues that they'll tell me about is they think that their memories are like they get told that they forget little details and stuff like that, and they're really concerned that maybe their memory is not so great. And so far, at least every time that that's happened when I've asked about it, it's been situations where they weren't actually paying attention at the time, so they didn't encode the information. Now that's a different situation to the one that you're presenting, where it's like in the moment, your working memory that kind of like holding it at the moment. This is related to having some focus still on it. So it's relevant if all of our focus, even for a split second, goes entirely to something else, that's gone. But that doesn't mean that we've forgotten all about it in the sense that our long-term memory has lost it. It means that it's lost relevance for a second to us at that moment. So, like, that's why getting Adrenalized and stuff like that can help for those kind of tasks potentially. But I also want to note, so, like, you're talking about applying for jobs, and that's a really difficult thing to keep on doing sometimes because you apply for a job, you may not even, like, hear back at all. And if you do, you might like you don't know how far you've actually gotten. It's a difficult situation to stay motivated in. And the more averse of something is, or the less faith that we have that our efforts are actually going to be useful, the less we're going to be able to focus on those things. So there are different aspects that might lead to the procrastination at that stage, which can be felt as that sense of, like, drifting and potentially losing track of what you're thinking about. But there will be other factors probably related, and that's why it's useful to kind of get into the situation, because maybe, like, that could be a really good potential goal to go over next time. Because what we will do next time is actually spend the time with every person to go over their goal and workshop it, not only to make sure down the track in the session that it meets all the criteria of, like, it's possible, it's feasible, it's achievable, that kind of thing. But you're addressing the main blocks in there that have stopped you from doing it so far. So it can be complicated. I hope that I'll be able to spend time with you next time to go over that if that's the goal that you have. But I just figured does that make sense? Just that the procrastination reason can come from many different sources. And I imagine particularly with jobs like applying for jobs, that most of the time, at least part of what causes like what makes that difficult for people is that sense of like it's just like this constant kind of feeling of rejection and you don't know whether it's going to be useful. And something that's really important for people with ADHD, in general, to be able to focus on stuff is the belief that it's actually worth it, you know, that the juice is worth the squeeze. And if you're not really sure if you're like, you know, you don't have faith that you're going to get that job even if you put in all this effort, it's going to take a long time. That's a situation that can be quite difficult to focus on. So building up that sense of hope might even be the first kind of step, potentially."

Myself, I'm 36 and I was diagnosed about four months after my son, who is now ten, about a year ago. And he was sort of struggling a little bit in school. And I had a teacher who was really lovely anyway, put me on that path and just it was basically like, look, let's look into a couple of different things. How can we best help my son at school? And we sort of ended up, as you do, you go through testing, et cetera. He's got inoffensive and so why? And I had an interesting time at the doctor years and years before that because I've always known that I felt different. I felt like there was something different with me and that everyone kind of knew this sort of secret or kind of how to do life, and I just didn't quite get it. I felt that's kind of like, overwhelmed, and I was like, why does everyone seem like they're all having a good time? And I'm just, like, stressing about the messy clothes in the cupboard and just all these things. And I constantly had this super highway of ideas and everything running through my mind, but on the surface, calm. No one could really see what was sort of going on. Anyway, I went to the doctor years and years ago and said, look, I think I've got ADHD. I've got a list as long as my arm of these symptoms. And I was told and I said, I think my son might have it too. And this is where my son was, only about three or four. He said to me, well, you're sitting here having a conversation with me, so no, you obviously don't have it. And I thought, well, he's a doctor, he knows what he's talking about, so I felt a bit weird about it, but I was led by the expert at the time anyway, so put that aside and then I was a bit annoyed. But anyway, now that I'm medicated and so my son, I've had mixed things with it because I'm also taking antianxiety medicine. So just finding a balance with all of that. Plus I'm a mom plus a volunteer, my husband volunteers and we have so many different things on my patience, a bit like Melini. My patience is, well I'm a very patient person, but I'm easily frustrated with little things. Like if I have a lot of external stresses in that moment, I find that I just blow up.

And then what your friends think is that that can often come up with your friends think that you're bored by them or aren't interested in what they're saying and stuff like that. And you might be still paying attention to what they're saying but look like you're not because there are other things going on in your mind at the same time. I wanted to point that out because it was relevant to what you had said as well. And this would apply to, I'm guessing, everyone to some degree would have some kind of identification with this."

This is when I'm working home.

In terms of using it in these sessions, it won't be like exactly 25 minutes at the start of each kind of jumping in and doing some slides. There will be the pomodoro will jump up, I'll say pomodoro time. And it's really just a way of like intermingling between talking quite quickly versus time, where we get to just relax and have a bit of conversation because that tends to be an easier situation of focusing for people with ADHD. All right, so inattentive versus hyperactivity. So I talked about this a bit. So the inotent of being easily distracted, easily distracted, potentially having trouble with organization. If you get distracted by something and potentially leave things behind and stuff like that, difficulty listening or that sense of drifting off and then you've got the presentation from the hyperactive side. So that can be tapping, having trouble sitting still, you know, rushing through tasks, making rash decisions. The reason why I go through these is I guess it's just essential to kind of have some idea of the diagnostic criteria anyway. But when you look at those characteristics of the hyperactive presentation, you can see that, I mean, really just they're an acted out presentation of what's going on underneath the people with the inattentive, because there's a higher requirement for external stimulation, as I mentioned before, to focus on one thing to the exclusion of all else. So then if someone is a slow talker or monotonous or something is not that interesting, then you get that easily distracted as a person is thinking about other things at once because their focus isn't fully drawn into one thing. Being disorganized, as I said, that can be because you forget things because you focus on something else. It also can be because you really don't want to do a boring or a task that doesn't seem meaningful. So then you rush it. And that rushing makes it more likely that you'll make mistakes or miss something out in terms of organization. But then the tapping and not sitting still and stuff like that. Well, people with ADHD are likely to do some sort of fiddling or tapping and stuff like that, more than the average person in attendance presentation anyway. And it's because there's even research to show that when people use fidget spinners or even they tap and stuff like that. For many people with ADHD, that can improve their ability to focus on one thing to the exclusion of all else because it's filling up some of that attention window without fully dragging them into another area of focus. The rushing through tasks I mentioned and then the making rash decisions. Well, I mean, the impulsive behavior is a characteristic of ADHD, inattentive or not. So I just wanted to make that point that that's to me why they still call it the same thing. Even though the presentation might seem quite different in attentive is just an acted out version in some sense of the sorry, the hyperactive is just an act out version in some sense of the inattentive. Now, the classroom experience, it's a really important one because it applies in my experience to pretty much everybody with ADHD to some extent tends to be a very, very strong driver for shame or guilt or feeling bad about things that you struggle with if you only try it as hard as other kids. That interpretation that teachers might have of the fluctuating ability that you present with on a day to day basis thinking, how do they just stay interested the whole time? Particularly not being diagnosed as a child, then seeing, not having any idea, no explanation that is different to the teachers thinking that it's actually just due to laziness or something like that can be really problematic. I do care. This is me trying or even later down the track, convincing ourselves that we don't care. So that it negates the need to see that vulnerability, to see that there is something that you're trying to do better in coming up short in some way and then you're so lazy part. I don't know whether any of you guys who seen The Nutty Professor the Absent Minded Professor, I think that might be. Yeah, The Nutty Professor is an Eddie Murphy movie anyway. So this picture of Williams, Robin Williams, it was just a brain. Yes, he was in this movie, he was this kind of like well, the Absent wine professor, he would get really caught up into his work. He was a genius. But then he was in love with this girl who he kept on letting down because you'd get caught up into his work and stuff like that. I put that there because if you watch the movie, that's ADHD and given that it was made in like the early 90s or eighty s, I bet you they didn't know that. So I've talked about the involuntary versus voluntary focus, hyper focus and losing time. So people with ADHD often feel that they have a poor perception of time. And I mean, we gain the perception of the monitoring of time by checking in on it. So then when we look back with hindsight and remember a time, then if we've checked in less because we were fully focused on one thing in particular, or there was enough time that passed where our focus didn't relent, enough to allow checking into what time it was and how much time has passed has become relevant, then you're likely to remember it as being a smaller amount of time. It's what we call trance. Now this can be built upon, right? Like if we intentionally note the time that we start something and then the end time, and then where we're necessarily taking that information and predicting getting an idea for the amount of time it's going to take next time and adjusting that based on I thought it was going to take me an hour. It took me half an hour. I thought it was going to whatever it is, then of course we're going to build that ability to detect how much time things take as well as anyone else. But to get a head start, it can be useful to set alarms for the end times as well as the start time, and even to be really decisive about the moments that we choose to do activities that don't have an end point. So, like, there are several people who I've spoken to, with ADHD, for example, who talk about, you know, they're always late to staff. I talk to them about what their process is in the morning and there'll be something like scanning their social media on their phone or something like that, that intentionally doesn't have an end point that they do in the morning and without, like, a start and end time, that's likely then to pull you in to the point that time passes and you're not realizing it. So there are different kinds of ways of when does it happen, what do I do, how do I lose track, how can I avoid that next time? I talked about training lifestyle to do with the week six and seven now the Medicare Belinda, so you're still muted."

And there was a method underperformer in high school. It resocked. So those voices of me being lazy and actually me kind of being stupid that have played a role. And so I always kind of a lot of facades, trying to work really hard, being doing okay. I am clever, I'm intelligent and put everything together and so yeah, it was pretty tricky, pretty tough. The social stuff seems to be pretty okay though. I was always kind of a people person and after high school into uni. So I was studying things that I was interested in, philosophy and education, teaching and the practicality of education and teaching. Currently in my school right now. And yes, it was really great academically. It wasn't easy, but it got better. Yeah, socially was awesome. And then I had a girlfriend at the time was studying clinical psychology. She was like, you know what, maybe you need to get tested. And I got test and diagnosed about four years ago and just before that I was certainly a bit of a risk taker in trying a lot of different kinds of prescription drugs and illicit drugs too. And so that just contextualizes why the context of someone handed me a Dexy and after conversation got ADHD. I was about to get diagnosed or about to get tested for it, and I took it at the end of a work day couple of days later, and it was like the static just dissipated. And I didn't realize that my whole life. There was a static that meant that I could only hear, like 40% of what people were saying. And it was like cognitive glasses got put on my head."

But I just find it really hard to implement, and I'm just wondering if it will really help to do something as visual and I'm just wondering if there are tools or AIDS for us. Say people are using a reminder app, and that works kind of okay, Use a reminder app called To Do List, for example. So like to-do-ist, that one allows you to have sub-reminders. So you can be like yeah, this is what I want to achieve overall, but this is the breakdown of what I do, 1st, 2nd, third, et cetera. That could potentially be a useful part. So then you've just got one thing you have to click off and say, yes, I've done it. Or you could click off all of those individual parts. Another one, and I don't remember the name of this off the top of my head, could find it. Somebody else might know it, though. In the past, when I've run this group, somebody mentioned there's a kind of reminder-based app that forces you at the start of each week to chunk up the time and put it into the calendar kind of schedule. So then you've just kind of populated the reminders, and then it says, okay, here's all your reminders. Chunk up. Figure out roughly how much time they have and place it in. I think that one may have been designed with ADHD in mind. So it kind of makes you do that kind of that forward-based planning. Are either of that kind of what you had in mind?"

        "value": "I see. Okay, so indeed adrenaline is heavily related to the nervous system. So in terms of our primary nervous system running down the spinal cord, you think of the parasympathetic nervous system being related to dearousal and the sympathetic nervous system related to getting revved up. When we get more Adrenalised, that signals for our body to get more revved up and that will do a bunch of different things all at once as though there's a fight flight situation. And that even happens when we're just getting Adrenalized because we're nervous and stuff like that. It's worth noting, though, with adrenaline fatigue, like you're talking about, generally speaking, where people get revved up adrenalized, even if it's pretty highly revved up, as long as they get a chance to get fully down. So they're not. Kind of staying a little bit open, like you've got like a touch on the gas pedal kind of thing, then that situation is very unlikely to lead to adrenaline fatigue. It tends to be from it's when people are they get revved up and then they go down to there. They don't go down all the way, so they constantly got some degree of adrenaline. But of course that would be something worth talking about with your psychiatrist if you're interested in taking stimulant medication or if you already do, because all of the baseline sympathetic arousal is going to be higher with either of the stimulant medications because of Norepinephrine dry mouth. That's something that occurs for people if they take a lot of Dextro amphetamine generally. And this is because salivation is part of the digestive system and the digestive system takes heaps of energy to run. And that's one of the key areas from which energy is taken to send to the bigger muscles in the arms and legs. So you can fight for your life or run for your life when you're really Adrenalized. That even happens when you're just like angry, but not physically active. But yeah, to the exclusion of the stomach. So it means that kind of stuff. You get less activity, less movement in the gut, less acid production where people have anxiety. So it is staying open, albeit they're not calming down over time. Part of what people get with adrenaline fatigue is they're using resources that are fine to use in bursts, but they're just not meant to be constantly used. We're not meant to be in a constant state of partial adrenaline. Does that help?"

I find any sort of planning super tedious, even if it involves planning to do something I would enjoy. So you can imagine if I'm planning to fold like underpants or something like that, there's just no chance. I don't think I've ever worn in my life socks that match. So it's like that's had a supreme cost in my life. So my goal for the week that was just passed was to build a bit of time to plan into my week. Because if I'm not planning in my work, I talk to my patients about smuggling all the time. But actually, to implement and to even conceive of smuggles, you have to spend a bit of time; you have to pause and think and spend a bit of time working that out and mapping it. And, in my life, I never do that for myself. I'll talk about it with others, but I won't do it for myself. So my goal was that for Wednesday and for Monday, I was going to spend time in the evening doing it. And actually, I just didn't do it. It's just like anything was infinitely more interesting. I think I combined some of my socks on Monday so that I wouldn't have to do it. Even so, it was a big failure for me; I have to say.

Often times they will always, you know, get that bad feedback if the person, you know, their manager or whoever it is, is really just trying to make them uncomfortable enough to leave the organisation.

I guess the bulk of the stuff that we talk about, say, in this group, like not necessarily getting into trauma and the deeper sides of things. So they would be more about specifically efficiency and getting stuff done and the strategies like the Pomodoro techniques and stuff like that, rather than because that kind of stuff happens with a therapist as well. But you also do anything else that's going to relate. In contrast, an ADHD Coach isn't a clinical psychologist, they're not going to necessarily like they're not going to be able to do all those other things. ADHD Coach is also not a protected term in the sense of like, so you can't call yourself a clinical psychologist unless you are one or you get a big bill. And even I have to pay $600 a year to keep my registration and to call myself an ADHD Coach. Anyone can do that. That's an action. I mean, therapist, anyone can call themselves a therapist as well because that's just the act of doing therapy, which isn't a protected term. It's interesting to note the difference between a protected term and not with some of these things that we may think are like nutritionists. I bet some of you may think, like, nutritionist is like, yeah, that's probably something they have to do, study, maybe get registration for, maybe we assume that on the cuff of it, a dietitian certainly does, but not a nutritionist. And that means that some nutritionists can be fantastic, but there is no kind of baseline, you know, the base training they must have done. Social interaction, fun and my time. So of course, exercise, sleep and diet are key components of stress management. No conversation about stress, be complete without social interaction, fun and my time. This is just getting out there, seeing your friends, and making sure the things you crave to do will be different for different people. Just literally the client that I was talking to last before I started the session today, he's fairly introverted, and he was kind of, like, wondering whether he should be trying to maintain more friendships. But I can see that it's not something that he desires, and he has a partner and dah dah dah."

Frankly, sometimes when I'm sleepy, I don't necessarily want to watch something novel or get into some new movie or something like that. So, I mean, just making it so it can be an enjoyable transition where you're like, hey, I'm going to chill out. I'm going to watch something nostalgic or something that I've enjoyed in the past.

So lack of loneliness and under stimulation and this is particularly true, as Jonathan was saying, for people who are more extroverted. So just having other people around and I have seen the flip side where some people with ADHD will say like no, I want it to be as quiet as possible because having people around like that's very distracting. Other people actually really thrive on having the sound around them like that. It depends on what the sound is. Some people can listen to music, for example, can be a great thing to listen to like a non language based entertaining, fairly like non complex music in the background. But any music will take me completely into it and away from the task immediately because I like music. But you figure out what works for you and it will differ person to person to some extent. More reason to rein yourself in that accountability that I was talking about, genuine interest. So because the degree of involuntary focus, focusing on things that are genuinely interesting at that moment is actually no problem for people with ADHD, this is often a very useful point when related to trying differently as opposed to trying harder. So rather than forcing ourselves to do a task using the Pomodoro technique or using whatever techniques that you use, we often use bullying techniques on ourselves to try to force ourselves. They don't work by the way. But any kind of attempt that's unpleasant to get yourself to do it, it's not going to even be the most effective if it is a task that is conducive to getting interested in. If you've ever been interested in it before, you can kind of get the idea that it's enjoyable even if you're not in it at that moment. Looking at finding ways to grande or pull your focus into it. It's the best way to actually end up with a result in terms of your action. But it's interesting to note that that actually wouldn't require too much effort. You know, it could be fun, it could be a good time. Whereas those other techniques a lot of effort and less result. All righty, so the consensual model, just combining those things high interest, looming disaster, adrenaline and other people these are the kind of three valuable things that can be used to make tasks in the moment more conducive for people with ADHD to do in your own time when you want to do it. And if you can get an overlap of two or more of these, the more the merrier. So associated with the looming disaster scheduling, fake deadlines make it a challenge gamify it set time as log progress, high interest starting with fun or talents being having that curious mindset, even watching YouTube videos about it. I got back into these slides, for example, when I needed to get really into it again and write them all by watching Ted Talks. Actually, it was by watching a couple of Ted Talks that I found really interesting in the past that pulled me back into the whole process and other people\u2014so announcing intentions, enlisting a buddy to have accountability, like a buddy when it comes to going for a walk in the morning and stuff like that as well, associated with our goals, accountability partners, even people. If you don't have anyone who lives on your street or lives nearby enough that that's reasonable to do, it can even be helpful sometimes to have like an honest accountability partner that you just chat with, you've got like you just regularly talk with about, did you do your thing today? So you're keeping each other on the ball from a distance. And it's that sense of community, even if they're not there during the moments that you're exercising or doing whatever it is you have a goal for."

All of our minds wander without us realising on a conscious level and we look to the environment for cues as to what we're doing before consciously learning it. This isn't just people with ADHD, of course, and so this happens in the background while we're doing a task what am I doing again? And at that moment we don't even know that it's happening and we either get pulled into something else based on like oh, that's what I'm doing, and then kind of jump into that and that might be half an hour later before you consciously realize and then pull yourself back. But you can set up choose in the environment that are associated with doing particular things. Like I was talking about with classical conditioning last time with the Pavlovian dog who salivates at the sound of a gong and using the Pomodoro technique with the egg timer so that you've got the auditory ticking anchor or some YouTube thing that has a Pomodoro thing that does a similar something and have the visual marker of the tomato timer on the table and stuff. These are the type of visual anchors and it's worth noting that there are plenty of situations where there are naturally visual anchors if you're digging a hole like they are, like they're wearing gloves, they're standing over a hole with other people holding a shovel. When that moment happens, it's like what am I doing again? Very clearly you know what you're doing. Same thing with doing a dishes or something like that, but where you're say using the computer that does a whole bunch of things, many of which are more exciting than the thing that you may want to force yourself to do. And they might have tabs that are open and other programs that are open which indicate at that moment that your brain is checking in. What am I doing again? That you're actually doing something else that pulls you in. So we're limiting that by removing those distractions and maximizing the ones that are associated with what we want it to be other people. So of course they provide an anchor to the task as well. If you're sitting around studying with people and you can see what they're doing, what you're doing, this provides a thematic anchor of like yeah, we're studying this subject as well."

And so what's essentially happened is my intense, and my whole thing is for the last three years has been on work, and I kind of burned out of Seattle. But what's also happened is my personal life is completely, utterly stagnated. And now that we're kind of, well, slowly emerging out of COVID, it's almost like I'm going to be stuck about how to reengage my personal life in any meaningful way. And it was always really anyway, so I thought of my goal in the last session you talked about how we need to plan, but we need to make planning a task. And the reality is I don't tend to plan anything. I'm quite fortunate that my work is very stimulating. I work people over those, manage their way and then lead them into rehab or method or something like that. So it's chaotic, very stimulating. But in my personal life, I'm just absolutely pathetically stuck. And one of the things is I don't do is I don't plan anything in my personal life, and it's almost like, how do I engage and do that? So then it leads to me doing meaningful, fun, connected, fulfilling things in my personal life rather than just sitting on the couch waiting to work on an essay, which is kind of the freedom that I've been learning. So that was necessary for a period of time. They were all locked up, it's no longer necessary now, but I don't know how to do that. So historically, I was always very poor at that. So I came out of a neighbouring relationship with my partner. I didn't manage the calendar for social events and then I moved after that ended I lived with a flatmate but then I moved in by myself, which is almost a complete disaster because now there's no motivation to do anything. The laundry is piled high, I get a cleaner once a month, and I only tidy 2 hours before the cleaner arrives and that sort of stuff. So, long story short, I think my task, I think my goal needs to be planning and then working out how do I put things that are meaningful into that plan and then progressing those was that too complicated?"

Which by the way, is that's what I generally use is the best way to make me clean as well. I joked during the lockdowns and I'm like, well I joked but it was kind of true. I couldn't do that anymore. I couldn't just invite somebody over to make myself clean the place. But yeah, maybe that could be a good solution. Just kind of picking maybe somebody you haven't seen in a while or somebody you'd like to catch up with. And once you've invited them around and you figure that they're probably going to come, you have to clean, then."

Like, that won't make you habituated to all types of stressful situations. It's just going to make you habituate to analogous type situations. So like, that kind of stress. So like, for example, I've done a lot of rock climbing. So when it comes to fear of heights being 100 meters up a cliff, that situation doesn't stress me out that much unless I haven't been climbing in a while or, you know, it's a really hard climb or something. But that doesn't mean that I won't get nervous in situations that are nerve-wracking for completely different reasons than height exposure. Does that make sense? So that's all good. And it's just worth noting that, like, certain aspects of jobs naturally lend themselves pretty well to people with ADHD being able to thrive in them. And, like, situations where people come up to us, where we've got emergent situations that we have to deal with at that moment, there's an absolute deadline at that second, and there's no time to think about it in advance that we have. To anything like that. It's very much on the cuff, then this can really be a strength for people with ADHD. Dealing with, like, emergency room situations, dealing with otherwise potentially overwhelming situations where you have to pay attention to many things at once. It would potentially overwhelm the average person. These can really be strengths for people with ADHD, which is why, say, like, for me, doing this job when I'm I think it's a little bit harder to stay focused when I'm, like, presenting in this way because there's less back and forward. But especially when I'm talking one-on-one with somebody who, like, you know, like they're there for a reason. It's very important to them to get something out of that session. It's important to me to help them, so then there's enough to keep me involved in that. But then there'll be the Admin side, which is charging. And oftentimes, especially people who excel at the top of their area, they can be potentially unlikely to see the disadvantages of ADHD very much, potentially to the point. So, say musicians, it might come up in some places. Like, I can think of a couple of musicians I've worked with, like, doing their tax and stuff like that could be really difficult. But actually, knuckling down and doing the creative side may not be an issue for them. Even like CEO-type environments where people are coming to you, they want your kind of off-the-cuff opinion or decision-making about things and stuff like that. These are situations that are conducive well to people with ADHD doing well, just that it's when you have to do the mundane or the lower stakes stuff that can take a lot of time and just feel like they're pointless. These are the really tough ones to get motivated in. So who hasn't gone yet? And you're up. Whoever has? Is anyone not gone yet? That's everyone. Alright, guys, what's the time? Got a few more slides there. Okay, I know it's 711 guys. I don't always finish late like this. I apologise. There aren't many slides left here, so dealing with multiple goals. So, of course, you care about more than one thing. How to best get a hold of many things at once. We've got to do it, as I've said over last week and this week, all new habits, one by one. Wait till they're a habit. We're likely to have a tendency to want to jump ahead and throw something novel on. So being aware of that bias and then with that in mind, being like, all right, I'm probably going to start to want to add extra stuff on before it's time. So once I start to want to, I can catch myself and be like, right, is this a habit? To such a point that I don't really have to think about it anymore because I do it as a matter of course in the morning or whenever. It is only once the answer is yes. Is it a good idea to place one on? And it is worth noting that, you know, once you've built up one, there are so many things that you're doing uniquely in that situation where you don't have to do that again in the second and the third and so on. So it gets easier over time. That first one is often the hardest because you don't have that kind of, you know, that proof to yourself that you can do it because you've just achieved it in other areas it might be something that you haven't looked at in quite some time."

So I was talking about the fact that most of the neurotransmitter and things like that, that our body has these don't come from our food. They're created through these chemical processes inside our body that come from constituents of our food. And we're catalysed by proteins precisely and stuff like that. But so the chemical process that makes up Norepinephrine, which is under regulated for people with ADHD, and is crucially important to be able to focus on one thing to the exclusion of all else, to just kind of funnel those priorities. And because it's only one more step, you got epinephrine or adrenaline, and then the next step is Norepinephrine. So then when we actually have access, our body is Adrenalized, which can be released, obviously, outside of the brain, that can cross the blood brain barrier. We have access to Norepinephrine at that time. So you think of, like, the last minute effect. You got high accountability, a gun to your head, like situations where the stakes are high enough that you have to act at that moment. They tend not to be an issue for people with ADHD. I've always said, like, if you put a gun to someone's head with ADHD and get them to do their tax, they will actually be able not only will they do it because they don't want to get shot. They will be able to do it where they may not have been able to do it without the gun point at their head."

I was prompted to see a psychiatrist to get diagnosed because I suspected I might have some disorder that affected concentration. I've always been academically inclined because I was a nerd, a relished. I was really into school, really into university, but I find it so hard to study, to get into it, particularly assignments. And I've always been a last-minute person. It's like once the pressure is on, there's a deadline. It's like; I somehow figure out 4 hours before the assignment is due; that's when you start. And it just caused tremendous stress, and that kind of just rolled over and started applying to work once I graduated. And last year I suffered an injury for which I had to rehabilitate, and I had to do exercise. And it wasn't anything strenuous like running for ten minutes, 1 minute off, 1 minute on, and I couldn't do it. My exercise physiologist had to stand next to me and symbolise me. Now, I'm a very determined person, and I was going nuts because I just couldn't concentrate, and I was really bored with it. And that's the reason why I started seeing a psychiatrist, plus a friend of a friend who's a cardiologist. She got diagnosed ten years after she started her speciality with ADHD. And I thought that prompted me to think, well, you can still because I think one of the reasons people tell me, particularly GPS and psychologists told me, is that I don't think you have ADHD because you have achieved so much. You will now be able to go through university and be wherever you are in your career if you have ADHD. And when I heard this common, this girl that I knew through my mutual friends suffered from ADHD, I just thought, well, that's all a lot of bollocks\u2014so decided to see someone. But it was really interesting. My doctor, my GP, who has known you for three years, and my psychologist, they were just like, I don't think you got it; I think you're wasting your time.

At that time, much of it was to do with feeling stressed, nervous, and overwhelmed. In general, I ruminate a lot. Like, I'm not doubting the overdiagnosis with that."

This is just regardless of our baseline for particular tasks, if we can pick the right one. And these techniques can be helpful. So a reminder of the Pomodoro technique and in more detail because it's about utilizing it specifically in your own time. So 25 minutes timer, that time could be more important. It is a researched amount of time that they find is ideal outside of that time. So longer wouldn't be ideal because it'd be too much time generally to stay really intently focused in an intentional way like that to get adrenaline that entire time to use this kind of technique. You could do shorter, but I wouldn't do any longer. Unless you are doing it and you. Got into a hyper-focus mode, and then there's no problem continuing. You can get plenty done there, and it can be really productive. But I've seen situations in the past running this actually where people will try to apply this, but they know in the back of their mind that they're going to get to the end of the 25 minutes, and they're going to keep on going because they've got more stuff. And they don't truly have permission from themselves that they will just do the 25 minutes. And because of that they procrastinate with starting. We don't want the minimum journey to be too far. Or it's like standing at the base of Mount Everest, looking up and thinking that's a really big mountain, no thanks. So, yeah, keeping it small and manageable and bite-size in a state that you can or an amount of time that you can stay realised for committing to the time in advance, setting up your desk, if that's wherever the workspace is that you're doing it on so that everything's ready to go. You got the plan. All you have to do is jump in and do it. So there's no thinking about that process while you do it. But you want to have, like, a very small amount of time just to kind of set things up so I can close down all the other programs on your computer, open up everything to do with that, maybe even chunk in some copied and pasted data. Even if it's not going to even be in the end result if it's some relevant stuff that you can condense or something like that, then it's a way to open up the blank page, and you're less likely to get distracted because you get okay, there's some text there. It's relevant and pulls me in - instead of there's a blank page completely. That's really boring. What else is there? Like wasting yourself like someone was saying last week and trying to make it faster than the last time or that you are focusing more intently than last time or act like a moment is too late. Any of these kind of ideas are associated with urgency, are ideal for this someone to say something? No. All right, chill between go for a walk, exercise, something like that. Alright. adrenalising the system. Okay, the last minute effect. So the brain on adrenaline and what happens and we have talked about this stuff, we get that narrowed focus, we make vital decisions to the point that we're very sure we stick in. That involves priority convergence. So we get that one thing done and that priority convergence. The last minute pattern, which is very common for people with ADHD. It's one of the kind of the classic things that I'll ask when I'm interviewing somebody who's interested in seeing whether they have ADHD is first I'll generally ask are you better at assignments or tests. Some people are actually better at assignments because they get really, really nervous about tests and that can relate to other experiences I've had."

And I think that the importance of the non-urgency is maybe where I tend to fall down a little bit because I kind of work with what's the next thing? And I'm always just like the next one, next one, next one, next on the next one. And I sort of have this list. I literally have all these people play around at the moment and I just in a way, find comfort in doing things quickly. I'm talking tasks because then I can data dump them and I don't have to think about them later. So regardless of how urgent or important it is, I'll just try. I'll try and do it. It doesn't work. I always end up either at the end of the day or at the end of the week because I've taken on so much that I've underestimated my time, stretched myself and etc. And then I fall in a hole and feel and I feel really responsible. I feel really shameful because I've said to people, I am going to do things and I feel and it just starts this really horrible cycle again that I'm I have trouble to pull myself out of, I think.

You must have seen the video, I'm guessing, that I was referring to of how to ADHD because those quadrants are it's like high importance, low urgency, high urgency, low importance, et cetera. And that quadrant that you're talking about where it's like high urgency, but sorry, high importance, but low urgency is often the part that's really hard for people with ADHD to address because there's no absolute deadline. We have to think ahead and define a time for that in order to prioritize it. And that includes things like our tax because there's no absolute point where we have to do it generally unless we really wait a long time or different things like that. But it's like get to it when you get to it. But it is if you think about it like really crucial to you that you've done it versus not doing it. And I think that this strategy of thinking ahead for a week and figuring out if is there anything and maybe even particularly thinking about is there anything that's important that doesn't have a particular time that I would fit it into. Then they would be the ones to fit in first potentially to make sure that you have time for them and then once you've done that a few times and even just like having done it once, it's one of those things that it makes you more of aware of it even when you don't specifically do it. Like in the past, there was like a week or two that I counted calories just because I was curious about developing my intuition for how many calories is something mainly out of curiosity, frankly. But the point is that I didn't have to count calories forever. Just doing that for one or two weeks was enough that I have a sense of it now and that's something that I can apply when I look at food, not that it necessarily stops me, but it is something that can apply in this situation. You do that looking ahead for the week and it becomes something you do intuitively without actually deliberately doing it. To some extent going into the future is my general experience and what I've seen for other people as well. So at least that means not effort forever in order to make this and retain it as a strategy. Pomodoro so saying no so reasons it's hard to say no in general, so we might be asked to do something that's more interesting than what we're doing, right? Like, if you say you've got a few things that you've got to study for university, you've got to do for work or whatever, but it's like the weekend you want to get out, you've been asked to go and hang out with some friends for lunch. That's something that if you can fit in that socializing, it's a good idea to fit that in. But sometimes we can't and sometimes that's going to be appealing enough that we'll start being like, oh, there's another day that I'll probably do this, I'll probably do it tomorrow. Not that I'll be hungover because I go out with friends and DA DA DA DA DA and then tomorrow there's no way I'm going to do it. But this kind of justifications that we come up in the moment to do that thing, we want to do that frankly if we really looked at it outside of the context of actually wanting to justify it, I'm not going to get that done if I don't do it today. Like that kind of thing. We want to be liked, of course, and we want to be helpful and why we must learn people pleasing. As I'll talk about, we've talked about briefly already and we'll talk about more in week nine in particular. But people pleasing is this kind of it's not just doing things for other people. It's a good thing to be generous and to care for people and to do things for people. There's no problem with that. It becomes people-pleasing in this sense when we do things for people outside of the resources that we have. And it is in the sense, it's often driven by the fear that if we don't do things for people, then they're going to leave. That's the reason why they value us. It is actually a compensation, right? Like, if we find out at any stage or we decide or determine at any stage when we're younger still here that we're likely to be rejected or it's inevitable, or we're likely to fail at things and that will lead to some sort of rejection or something like that, then we may develop other compensatory techniques, doing things for people. Class clown, unrelenting standards. These are all examples of those. And the people pleasing can be a really tough one because it means if the concern for the person who's doing that is like, what if they actually don't, you know, they don't want to be friends with me after I stopped doing these things, then that means taking that risk. But it's worth noting that without taking that risk, that you don't get the opportunity to see that it's not required."

People will say exactly what you did, Jonathan, but it's like, well, I don't know how long things take and stuff like that. And I have worked with several people to actually build up that sense over time, where even if I'm seeing them individually, then we can come up with, all right, so try this out. We're going to check in on it. We come up with an estimate for how long? I write that down, and then we note I get them to actually, like, they've got a reminder for the time that they start, and I get them to note down the time that they end, and then we compare it. And once you've done that intentionally a couple of times, you often start kind of doing it in the background because it becomes like, oh, it's this useful thing and then your brain's like, what? I'm going to map that in the background so that I can get a sense of it. Like any of these things.

Like, it's so easy to get caught in the sense that as parents, you've got to be perfect in front of your kids, and the truth couldn't be more different than that in a sense. Like, it is about like especially given that for people with ADHD, your kids are likely to inherit some traits there, right? So you don't want to be showing them that it is not an acceptable thing to have these challenges, right? You want to show them that you can have those challenges that they may have with temporal or whatever it is. But even though they see it, they see that you deal with the challenge and that you're okay with it, so that when they have that issue, or if they have that issue down the track, then they don't feel terrible about it. Like, this often happens, like jumping out of ADHD as a context for a moment. Often times people will, like, in their relationship as parents, not fight in front of their kids. And then what happens is because they're like, oh, you don't fight in front of the children. That's not something that's appropriate. But then they grow up and they're likely then to get into relationships but have too much of an idealized perspective. So once they get into, like, arguments with their spouse, they're like, it's ruined. This isn't what good couples, good relationships do because they haven't seen that that kind of negotiations and compromises and stuff need to happen and arguments are okay. And that very much relates to this idea of the challenges within ADHD as well. It's not about being perfect. It's about showing the mistakes and that they can be gotten through."

So people here may even have tried the Pomodoro technique in the past and have gotten to the point where they're like, well, this doesn't work for me because I just get into the habit of dismissing them. It is very easy to get into that habit. We're likely all to do it at some stage, to be fair. But the way to pull back from that to getting back into the pattern of, like, it sparing you to actually do stuff is to actually cull down the amount of things that you're using the Pomodoro technique for so that you're building up that sense of, like, you don't ignore the alarm, you straightaway do it. And then you get used to that kind of the feeling of relief, the feeling of productivity, of utility when you actually jump into it and do it. So you're taking away some of the aversion and you're also building up that classical conditioning association with being adrenalized. So that's just a note for people, because it's very easy to have utility from something like a pomodoro technique for a while or reminders or anything like that, but then potentially to get to a point where it's no longer effective and it is possible to draw that back. But oftentimes it does mean confining the amount of things you're using it for a while. I wanted to point out because that's something that often comes up. Did anybody else not get a chance to apply anything from last week? The reason why I'm asking about this is not to like, single people out. Belinda will come to you in an SEC because it looks like you're ready, but it's just all about kind of noting that it doesn't always happen, as in, like, even if we're entirely playing goals and wholeheartedly want to do them, there are other things that can get in the way. And it's worth realistically reviewing that, which we do over the next couple of weeks regarding our goals as well. But it's just that kind of aspect of fairness and noticing what we did do or what we didn't do, or even not getting caught into the notion of, like, thinking that you failed at something that realistically wasn't the intention anyway. If you haven't, like, set the reminders or set up a task and stuff like that, and that's fine because this course is about picking the eyes over. I want to note that sometimes that happens and it's very easy to see it as failure. So blender."

But maybe if you look into that and find a way to rejig it, let us know if it works out well. Yeah, the name of that app will come to mind, by the way. The app that I have in mind chunks up the times, by the way, it was a small one-time fee, I think, to buy it. But just so you know, anyway, this curious mind idea. So you might have come across this notion and particularly when it comes to like reviewing smart goals and looking back on them really. If you imagine that, imagine that you're a scientist conducting an experiment, so there are participants in it, and you're not one of them, generally speaking. And so there are some experiments, some methodology that you're putting them through, and then you've got a prediction for what you think will happen. The prediction for the experiment is that you're setting where you're the participant here. Because that's essentially what we're doing with a goal, right? We're setting up an experiment, putting ourselves into it, where the circumstance, the time, outlines the experiment, what we place on our agenda, the reminders and everything like that. All of that is part of the experiment. So then, if we get to the end of the week, well, first of all, it goes back to that idea that the hypothesis has to be that you will complete it. So then if it's like, you know, that your guess overall if you were running an experiment, your hypothesis would be like yeah, we probably won't complete it because of X, Y and Z. Well then we need to rejig it until the answer is that you will do it. But then once you get to the end of that week or the end of whatever time period that you've chosen, then it's all about kind of jumping back into that role of the experimenter and looking back as though like taking yourself out of it in a sense and looking back with that curious mind of like, right, so this was the experiment, the confines, including the reminders and everything like that, that are going to keep you in line kind of. I thought that the participant was going to do X, Y and Z, and there was a deviation from that. So what caused that deviation? And that's what kind of gets you into that headspace of like of looking for the actual objective reasons why there might have been some and deviation from there instead of just getting caught up into beating ourselves up or reacting to that sense of, that fear of the inevitability of coming across as incapable or something like that. So hopefully, you created a situation for which the hypothesis was successful,ful but now it's data gathering. So we're just kind of throwing ourselves back into that. As a scientist, you don't get tied up in how things actually landed. That's just the observation. It's kind of like getting mad about the weather, in a sense. We might be frustrated in the weather if we've got an expectation, and then that's kind of subverted, and we were hoping to be able to do stuff that's now cancelled, but at the end of the day, those things are out of our hands. And very much in the same way that I think it's pretty reasonable to say that any goal that you might have in mind that as long as reasonably, it is achievable that you've made sure that those aspects are followed. Then there will be a set of circumstances like all the stuff you place there to get yourself to remember it and do it and everything. There will be a set of circumstances that will lead to the absolute completion of the goal. As long as you believe that, then it's really just a matter of finding those set of circumstances. This means that the thing that you question, the thing that you potentially alter week to week or time period to time period as you're modifying your goals, is all the stuff around it and not yourself. It is not the idea that you're then incapable; you're not able to do it. The assumption is that you are capable of completing the goal under the right circumstances, and we just have to find them because, generally speaking, that will be true. That situation will be most conducive to actually completing the goal over time and keeping it going as well. So if the experiment was not in line with your hypothesis, what about the situation that did not lend itself to the goal? And that's where we talk back about those barriers that we were talking about on the slide before the failure reaction. And this is part of the reason why it's so easy to get or so tempting to get caught in that failure. The dichotomy of seeing any slight deviation from perfection as a complete failure is that if we have experiences in the past, generally from early in life, that indicate to us where we essentially draw the conclusion that something bad and very important is awry such that we're inevitably going to fail or be rejected or whatever it is. These core ideas tend to stick with this, and it'll lead to a disproportionate emotional reaction to the possibility of failing in that particular way. And because, like I've talked about in the past that there are situations that people with ADHD are quite likely to experience early on, like with school and stuff like that, that can be perceived as failure outside of their control, outside of what they predict and therefore potentially inevitable. You never know when it's going to come up. That situation can lead to a disproportionate emotional reaction when there are ambiguous situations that might be failures. Like for example, if you get criticism from somebody, that could be because they're having a hard time trying to prop themselves up. That could be because there's something legitimate that you can reasonably tweak to do better and good useful criticism. And that can also be because you haven't hit the mark even though you've tried your best and are incapable of it. That third option is not the most likely. Still, it's oftentimes where that really high emotional reaction is and can feel like it's more likely for that reason, even if we kind of intellectually understand that it's not that likely. It feels so much so that it can drive us to checking-behaviour or to try to disprove the idea. One of the things I may have mentioned in the past that is common for people who have who find it really difficult to take on criticism because of that kind of triggering of that incapability kind. Of framework that may come from experiences earlier on that they would find very difficult to take on, like useful feedback. Because the first place their mind will jump to is, I must reject this so that I don't have to believe that I'm actually the failure that I feared I was. And therefore, it's like it leads to immediate self-justification and can lead to a lot of frustration from employers or supervisors or whatever it is, whoever it is who is trying actually to give us meaningful criticism. Bit of divergence there, but hopefully useful and certainly related there. So the result of unresolved forms regarding failure is that we can have that disproportional emotional reaction to any amount of failure or even ambiguous signs and to discount partial success because failure is the more salient emotional trigger, even though there are weighted triggers on either side of like, how much did I fail?"

So prioritising, make sure that you are applying. So remember, this was like coming up with the ideas for goals that people had and then keeping those in mind as we went through this in terms of refining. So that's kind of the perspective that I had in mind while I was going through these slides, and I realised that we're a week on now, but at least just think about would I have changed the goal that I have in mind or any other goals going into the future with these things in mind. So make sure you're applying the principles from last week. So do you already have the week before last now? Do you already have too much on? Would it be better to refine existing goals instead of making you more exciting goals? And of course, with that, it's important to train ourselves to be able to spot those times at the moment when we're being asked to potentially take something else on, to do something extra that we hadn't already planned to, which we'll talk about just in the next slide. But once we have, then it's just like, all right. I've caught that moment where I'm being requested something of me. Now I'm going to do that check, think forward, think about what is most important, not just what seems urgent in terms of has done a timely matter. If it is done, I care about having done it based on the amount of time that it's going to take me more than other tasks. And if you have other things on and don't have enough time or don't have enough resources up your sleeve to get those things done, they're already there that are more crucial than the thing that you might want to add, plus those other things, then it's really important not to add the other things at that time. And that training effect can make that something that you ultimately don't really have to think about down the track, but at the start, which would be a goal if people want to set it up as a particular trained regime. Somebody saying something, well, I can't hear it now, that's all good. So the list of domains that you care about. I mean, this is one way of looking into potential future goals that you may want to have. So just looking at fitness, work, relationships, and creativity, what are the different aspects already there? And in general, like we were talking about last time, it is a really good idea to pick goals that have already been sitting there rather than to come up with new dopamine that perhaps you haven't engaged with for a while. Unless there aren't stale goals that have been sitting there that we've wanted to get done for a while. Are any errors already pulling you down? So you know the feeling. Address those areas first. Focus on habit-forming over grand ideals, which is that kind of like one at a time until it gets to the point that you don't really have to think about it too much anymore on a conscious basis. And then you can add more on without that extra overwhelm factor of having too many things that you've got to add at the same time consciously. All right, and this would just be a consideration. Would you have changed that goal at that time? Next, refinement. So to initiate using Smart Goals, you'll probably come across this acronym if you worked well, teaching mental health or anything like that. It's also a really important note to make sure that whatever it is that you're trying to change, that the goal is based on, is completely in your control. So many times, people will come up with goals like, I want to achieve a certain grade, for example, right? And it's like, well, yeah, you can have that in mind as something you would like to do. But the overall mark isn't something that's in our control. There are things that we know are going to make us more likely to get a better mark, like making sure that we've spent the time preparing, making sure that we're perhaps using various methods that are going to help us learn. But there must be specific things that we can enact and be totally certain about whether we've enacted them. So that, say, if the overall thing you care about is to get a better grade, the things you have on there make that more likely. You can still end up getting a better grade. But if you have done all of those things that you've had in mind, like studying or whatever it is, and that hasn't resulted in whatever grade you have in mind, you have still 100% succeeded in that endeavour. And I mean, we know particularly after tweaking like a regime of learning and stuff like that over time, that absolutely will lead to the best situation that we can set up in terms of getting the best grades that we can, rather than beating ourselves up about and getting caught up about how much we actually know and everything like that tends to be much better to just focus on. Have I done this thing? Cool, I've done that thing. Then you can turn up on the day knowing that you've done the requirement that was in place, right? And then the rest is up to faith because instead, we tend to beat ourselves kind of up, or it's very easy for people to get very nervous on those exam days. What if there's something there that I don't know? Whatever it is, we will not increase the likelihood of knowing what is on the exam by getting nervous at that time. It's all about and like; this is easier said than done but focusing on, you know what, I've done those things. This is going to lead me to the best position. Just kind of doing it at that stage. That tends to lead to dropping off those nerves over time. There are other factors, of course. They're making sure that it's measurable, which to me is very much akin to making sure that it's specific so that you know exactly whether it has been done and, again, to what extent it's been done. You know, like if I wanted to increase my exercise and I had a plan to on particular days to do two bouts of exercise in a particular way, then I'd be able to check in and be like, right, so I did one of them and not the other. I did both, or I did neither. The point is that I'm very clear on whether the goal has been achieved, making sure it's achievable. And this one's really important because if we set up multiple goals all at once, or we set something, or we set up a goal that we already have too many other things on so we don't have the extra time or resources to do that. There are plenty of situations that we can throw ourselves into where on the face of it, we could see that we're probably not going to be able to succeed in that. And just like if we were maybe helping someone younger to learn that, we wouldn't want to set them up with something that they're unlikely to achieve. What we want is to have whatever the requirement is, the goal that we're essentially helping someone else, which we would also apply to ourselves when we're making those goals. We want it to be a challenge. But the hypothesis, our guess, is that probably being able to do that doesn't mean it will happen 100% of the time, but that's the goal. And if we look back on it and let's say we have achieved half of the goal or we haven't achieved the goal or whatever it was that prevented 100%, that if we look back on and we realised that, we probably knew that we weren't going to do that. Gold, and that's the part that we need to rejig next time, instead of jumping perhaps from zero days a week of something to five days a week. And we discussed that idea last time of the frequency, how many times you should plan based on how many times per week or in whatever frequency range that has been happening recently."

One of the other things that we'll talk about today, which is relevant, is just that one of the things for people with ADHD that comes up a lot is the idea, like, look, I know I'm capable of doing these things like, once, twice, here or there, but I don't believe that I can be consistent over time. And the thing is that we can't just in some short term get evidence that you can be consistent over time, but it has to be built up kind of week by week. But we can break it down so it's like, well, a week, like even if we review it in a week, that's the start of consistency. If it's something that you believe that you can retain. Sometimes with people who I'm working with individually, we will actually set up like some tiny goal, like something that is very well achievable for them that it can do on a consistent basis just to prove to themselves that anything can be consistent. So if it's something that you want to do long term, so maybe two days is like a good start and then it could be like and another thing that we'll also talk about is like, we stick with one goal at a particular level until it becomes a habit and that's when we add on top of it. But we'll get into that stuff as we go. Okay. And if you come up with the particular days, the particular times, or the particular actions that you want to take, and then set reminders around that so that you've got those times when you know that you're most likely to be in a location that you can do those things that you need to do. So what action would you take in order to reduce that behaviour for two other days? Sorry, I was jumping back into what you first said as an example. That's my point. Confused. Okay. With the physio stuff. How long does that take and do you do that? I presume at home."

Particularly if you've got a place that is associated for you with clearing your head or something like that, it's a really good idea to make that a regular part of your, say, weekly regime where you just have a bit of space, a bit of time on your own. And of course, this is going to be more difficult for some than others say, like parents and so on, but probably more important as well because you have a lot that you have to pay attention to, a lot of reliance on you and everything like that and it just means more cause for having a bit of a break sometimes. So take time away from tasks, schedule time in to go and unwind, and give yourself a little moments of relief and reflection. This is crucial for performing at your best and enjoying life, especially with ADHD. So in the next slide from three weeks ago, the rest is important. That lower tension rest. And it's particularly important for us because, if you remember, the analogy that I gave was like, if you're building a fence, some physical activity that's strenuous on a hot day, you're not going to go to the gym on your lunch break if you want to maximise your performance in that particular domain. So when you're utilising your self-control as much as you possibly can do whatever task, it's a really good idea to spend your breaks doing something where you're just kind of wandering around. You're not imposing structure, or you're not imposing things on yourself during that time so that you can rest that muscle, so to speak. It's only muscle, but you know what I mean. So attention is a limited resource. We all run out, not just people with ADHD, but breaks should not be attention-heavy, even games, because they can be quite heavy. Even if you're really interested in potentially draining. If you've got other tasks that are using a lot of self-control. I'll just jump into that. We'll have a quick break. I must have taken out the slide that was relaxed. Does anybody have any questions about any of those or comments?"

So there was no little mistake. Instead, the idea was I need to excel in some way so that I'm like defining myself as good and that'll be the thing that people might value me for or whatever it is. These aren't like conscious-on-the-face kind of thoughts, but they're kind of underneath it all. Does that help? Does that make sense?"

Sometimes I can focus well on stuff and be very productive, other times because I can't organize my thoughts or I'm just not thinking in a linear way, I can try a task and an hour later I've got one sentence on the page or something. It's like there's different experiences of time and different reasons why time is going wrong."
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Yes, and that's where it does become quite situational. What I was referring to mainly there is the idea that a lot of people know who have ADHD, that they don't know how much time things take. So that can be rectified and figured out over time in terms of losing track or realising that sometimes. You'll be in the mode and be able to focus on those things, maybe even if they're not particularly interesting. But other times you'll really struggle get stuck too. Yeah. So there are a couple of reasons that that can happen and generally, I guess, a combination of a couple of them, but certainly ADHD or not, the more averse of a task is for any reason, the more we're going to want to avoid it. And it could be aversive because it was unpleasant last time, it could be aversive because we don't expect to do well in it or anything like that. So that can still be there. But even without that, if we've done exercise that day, that's the other one of those three commanding your focus. By the way it's exercise occurred to me now. So if we exercise that day where that's going to upregulate Norepinephrine and dopamine so, then those situations you might find easier to focus, or a situation where the stakes are higher or there's more accountability that other people would know, or you'd be letting someone down if you didn't do it then and there. Having an absolute deadline can be a useful good thing. Situations like, say, doing our tax can be really challenging because there's no absolute deadline where, like, you have to do it at a given time, so it can end up being tomorrow never comes type thing and different ones will come up as we go. But like, yeah, there definitely are these different reasons for it. But the situation, given that you've experienced a situation where you can focus sometimes, once we identify what it is about that situation that is different from the other, then you should be able to take advantage of that more willingly just by being aware of and being able to mimic it. And I've just got there. So medication, just talking about the different types of medication. So the way that it works I've mentioned is that it up regulates both the neurotransmitter dopamine and Norepinephrine that are under regulated for people with ADHD dopamine. I think I've got a section on I'm going to jump back, but I think I've got a slide on it. Okay, here we are. I may as well just go to the main slide when I'm talking about this section. So the Norepinephrine, this is related, as I was saying, to decision consolidation. This is the one that you can get more access to any time you're adrenaline. So the Pomodoro technique and stuff like that. And it means that because in the last minute, when something does have an absolute deadline or you're going to let someone down, if you don't do something that the stakes feel higher, that can adrenalize us to an upfront extent often so that we can get stuff done. It's also worth noting that if you've got two days on the weekend to do something that's going to take half a day, not only is it very common that people with ADHD will leave it to the last half of Sunday, but you might find that you're not actually able genuinely to focus on it until that time. Because it's only at that time that you are adrenalized and therefore able to convert your priorities to just that task, before which it can be very difficult without a very specific strategy like we've been talking about. Don't mean, of course, being related to the reward system. Now when we either achieve something that we see is better than expected or something happens to us that's better than expected, then we're going to get a spike in dopamine and a suppression of dopamine if something is worse than expected. But when dopamine is underregulated as it is for people with ADHD, all else being equal, then the spike is smaller and the suppression is greater. So the intrinsic feeling of achievement for people with ADHD tends to be smaller than the average person. So less kind of like internal celebration of achieving a productivity tasks and stuff like that. And the suppression is greater when we don't live up to our expectations. Meaning that that intrinsic feeling of oh crap, that didn't feel very good, that is stronger as well. General activity and the drive for stimulation because there's a higher requirement for external stimulation. People with ADHD tend to seek out novel situations where there's more stimulation, more kind of more access to potential dopamine and also seek out more stimulation. If something is boring, we tend to think of something else. At the same time. The interior cingulate cortex or ACC is an area of the brain about here that is related to slowing down enough so that we're able to do something in a different way. So when the stakes are high, like, let's say that if you're driving a car really fast versus driving slowly, so then the stakes seem higher in the sense that if you crash, it's worse, right? In that situation where the interior cingulate cortex would be active in order to make us slow down, in order to decide whether we want to do things differently because the stakes are higher. Now the dorsal at the prefrontal cortex, this is another part of the brain that is smaller and has less connections to people with ADHD. All else being equal. Both of these areas of the brain, by the way, can be built up so that's related specifically to selfcontrol or inhibitory control. And the combination of the interior cingulate cortex and endorseltic prefrontal cortex being smaller on average is that relationship with self control and the tendency to have even a higher emotional volume to move forward. There's less inhibition relative to the amount of forward push there is for a person with ADHD. Loss being equal. Just jumping back to where I was, and then we can show for a little bit. I know that was a lot. And meet the top one for me is Zoe."
