And that is something that my friend we talked about every time I have to have people over there, like, yeah, it's a mad rush, and I get everything clean. It's fabulous.

And when we tend to rush, like focusing on as long as you see the stakes as high, like it's important enough to do it, focusing is acceptable in those situations, particularly having the accountability of another person in front of you. So you've got that clear making it real, but where things are mundane and there's a sense that it's not that useful or necessary or exciting anyway, but you've got to do it. But these are the things that people with ADHD would tend to rush, which is going to make them more likely to make silly mistakes, but they're trying to get it done as fast as possible and get rid of it. And also then to focus on something other than those. Details because they're trying to rush through the next person. Was there anything else you wanted to ask or say? Nelini.

I mean, Wednesday and Friday, I train with my EP, and therefore I get up, but I want to do it without his assistance.

But I will. Tell them and I will give them that positive way or positive boundary. And it could be something like, I'm feeling really stressed at this moment, and I want to give you my attention. I need five minutes first. It's sort of like showing even your family as well, like partner and stuff too, and being strict with your own boundaries because stress, I've got anxiety going for everything, but I would say that I'm working with mental health experts, et cetera, and looking at nourishing yourself as well.

I'm jumping forward to a section that relates to that that I put up as like a meme for today. Here the ADHD experience in conversation. So the idea of what your teachers think that your head is in the clouds because if you're thinking about a whole bunch of things but you don't seem like you're paying attention to that particular thing, then their assumption is that you're off with the ferries but you might be thinking about to you much more interesting things. And then what your friends think is that that can often come up with your friends think that you're bored by them or aren't interested in what they're saying and stuff like that. And you might be still paying attention to what they're saying but look like you're not because there are other things going on in your mind at the same time. I wanted to point that out because it was relevant to what you had said as well. And this would apply to, I'm guessing, everyone to some degree would have some kind of identification with this."

So these are all options within that list of the possible things to interact with at that moment when we funnel that down. So this happens when we're Adrenalised or need to get focused and get something specifically done. We naturally give up our lateral thinking, our ability to think about things in different kinds of creative ways and stuff like that, temporarily in order to really funnel down and just get one thing done. And that happens when we have higher Norepinephrine, which happens to people with ADHD as well. We've all experienced it when there's an absolute emergency, when things are just kind of going crazy and you have to just kind of go for it and do it."

It could even be like if the things you've tried in the past aren't particularly wouldn't particularly work now, or you don't particularly feel keen on them. Maybe just like trying one novel thing that maybe you've thought about in the past or something like that, just to see whether that might be something conducive to using over time, like whether it's swimming or whether it's, I guess you'd have to brainstorm maybe do some searching or something like that to figure out what fits within that. Do not get your heart rate over too much. That is also going to potentially be fun or interesting."

    {
        "instruction": "It's kind of hard to see the successes, though.",
        "output": "That's why we've got to be so intentional about looking back and being like our minds might jump to dismissing it, like, yeah, but anyone can do that. I should have done that years ago or whatever. And it's like, well, hold on, if I didn't set this goal up, how much of this would I have done? The answer is, well, probably zero. So how much did I do? Am I glad that I did that versus not? This is usually yes, and it's like, well, who cares how easy we might perceive whatever it is to be? We know how hard or how debilitating not completing some of these things is. And I mean, that's the difficulty we're presented with in terms of getting them done, at least how we have been doing them. I just wanted to mention that one. Because so often people are like, yeah, I did my goal. And it'll be like, often, even something really quite significant. But they're like, they still see it as something that they should have been able to do more easily, whatever that even means. And therefore that they shouldn't be so pleased with themselves because maybe they think they should have done it years ago or something. If there's anything that you could have done that we could have done years ago, then we never get the feeling of reward from completing it. Well, then, we're never going to do it. It's important to keep that in mind. Especially because the things that we tend to find difficult as people with ADHD, like the goals to really get motivated in, are often things that, at least to our perception, neurotypical people find quite easy to do. But it is worth noting that many of the things that they find difficult to do, we don't. It's just a difference. Yes.

I've got a couple of friends who are trying to do the same, and I failed miserably in my mind, but it's been excellent listening to the chat so far, and what I got really was I did go for at least one run on the weekend, and that was like 40 minutes. But I think the thing for me was it wasn't a clear goal. It is really important to me, and I hadn't emphasised that to myself enough. And I really need to set basically in my mind, just get changed each day at work. And whether it's a ten-minute run or a walk, it's just something because I know how important it is for me and how much I really enjoy it and how much it just has so many other benefits throughout the day for me.",

    },
    {
        "instruction": "Just annoying because that's my calendar. That's where all my stuff goes. I don't want to have another app.",
        "output": "True, it depends on how they work, but you can sync things with your calendars and stuff. But maybe if you look into that and find a way to rejig it, let us know if it works out well. Yeah, the name of that app will come to mind, by the way. The app that I have in mind chunks up the times, by the way, it was a small one-time fee, I think, to buy it. But just so you know, anyway, this curious mind idea. So you might have come across this notion and particularly when it comes to like reviewing smart goals and looking back on them really. If you imagine that, imagine that you're a scientist conducting an experiment, so there are participants in it, and you're not one of them, generally speaking. And so there are some experiments, some methodology that you're putting them through, and then you've got a prediction for what you think will happen. The prediction for the experiment is that you're setting where you're the participant here. Because that's essentially what we're doing with a goal, right? We're setting up an experiment, putting ourselves into it, where the circumstance, the time, outlines the experiment, what we place on our agenda, the reminders and everything like that. All of that is part of the experiment. So then, if we get to the end of the week, well, first of all, it goes back to that idea that the hypothesis has to be that you will complete it. So then if it's like, you know, that your guess overall if you were running an experiment, your hypothesis would be like yeah, we probably won't complete it because of X, Y and Z. Well then we need to rejig it until the answer is that you will do it. But then once you get to the end of that week or the end of whatever time period that you've chosen, then it's all about kind of jumping back into that role of the experimenter and looking back as though like taking yourself out of it in a sense and looking back with that curious mind of like, right, so this was the experiment, the confines, including the reminders and everything like that, that are going to keep you in line kind of. I thought that the participant was going to do X, Y and Z, and there was a deviation from that. So what caused that deviation? And that's what kind of gets you into that headspace of like of looking for the actual objective reasons why there might have been some and deviation from there instead of just getting caught up into beating ourselves up or reacting to that sense of, that fear of the inevitability of coming across as incapable or something like that. So hopefully, you created a situation for which the hypothesis was successful,ful but now it's data gathering. So we're just kind of throwing ourselves back into that. As a scientist, you don't get tied up in how things actually landed. That's just the observation. It's kind of like getting mad about the weather, in a sense. We might be frustrated in the weather if we've got an expectation, and then that's kind of subverted, and we were hoping to be able to do stuff that's now cancelled, but at the end of the day, those things are out of our hands. And very much in the same way that I think it's pretty reasonable to say that any goal that you might have in mind that as long as reasonably, it is achievable that you've made sure that those aspects are followed. Then there will be a set of circumstances like all the stuff you place there to get yourself to remember it and do it and everything. There will be a set of circumstances that will lead to the absolute completion of the goal. As long as you believe that, then it's really just a matter of finding those set of circumstances. This means that the thing that you question, the thing that you potentially alter week to week or time period to time period as you're modifying your goals, is all the stuff around it and not yourself. It is not the idea that you're then incapable; you're not able to do it. The assumption is that you are capable of completing the goal under the right circumstances, and we just have to find them because, generally speaking, that will be true. That situation will be most conducive to actually completing the goal over time and keeping it going as well. So if the experiment was not in line with your hypothesis, what about the situation that did not lend itself to the goal? And that's where we talk back about those barriers that we were talking about on the slide before the failure reaction. And this is part of the reason why it's so easy to get or so tempting to get caught in that failure. The dichotomy of seeing any slight deviation from perfection as a complete failure is that if we have experiences in the past, generally from early in life, that indicate to us where we essentially draw the conclusion that something bad and very important is awry such that we're inevitably going to fail or be rejected or whatever it is. These core ideas tend to stick with this, and it'll lead to a disproportionate emotional reaction to the possibility of failing in that particular way. And because, like I've talked about in the past that there are situations that people with ADHD are quite likely to experience early on, like with school and stuff like that, that can be perceived as failure outside of their control, outside of what they predict and therefore potentially inevitable. You never know when it's going to come up. That situation can lead to a disproportionate emotional reaction when there are ambiguous situations that might be failures. Like for example, if you get criticism from somebody, that could be because they're having a hard time trying to prop themselves up. That could be because there's something legitimate that you can reasonably tweak to do better and good useful criticism. And that can also be because you haven't hit the mark even though you've tried your best and are incapable of it. That third option is not the most likely. Still, it's oftentimes where that really high emotional reaction is and can feel like it's more likely for that reason, even if we kind of intellectually understand that it's not that likely. It feels so much so that it can drive us to checking-behaviour or to try to disprove the idea. One of the things I may have mentioned in the past that is common for people who have who find it really difficult to take on criticism because of that kind of triggering of that incapability kind. Of framework that may come from experiences earlier on that they would find very difficult to take on, like useful feedback. Because the first place their mind will jump to is, I must reject this so that I don't have to believe that I'm actually the failure that I feared I was. And therefore, it's like it leads to immediate self-justification and can lead to a lot of frustration from employers or supervisors or whatever it is, whoever it is who is trying actually to give us meaningful criticism. Bit of divergence there, but hopefully useful and certainly related there. So the result of unresolved forms regarding failure is that we can have that disproportional emotional reaction to any amount of failure or even ambiguous signs and to discount partial success because failure is the more salient emotional trigger, even though there are weighted triggers on either side of like, how much did I fail?"

        "instruction": "I struggle particularly with writing emails, especially when it's essential.",
        "output": "And the first sentence is probably not in your final copy. Your first sentence cannot be as good as you want it to be because to be as good as you want it to be, it has to be surrounded by a bunch of other sentences that incorporate it in which it makes sense and builds toward things together. And the first sentence won't do that. So just like just write. And I've even done this with people who are particularly nervous about like say doing uni assignments and stuff like that, where they've had bad experiences in the past. One time, for example, I got someone to write themselves an email which was essentially an essay question that they had. So she was studying social work and had to do an essay on whether it was something to do with pregnancy and the COVID vaccine or something like that. So I got it. She sends herself an email as though it's from a friend of hers who's pregnant. Just like asking casually the question so that she can see it as a real task and also a casual one, which doesn't have the whole kind of performance thing attached to it. So write it like an email and then you realize, okay, it's not going to be in that form later. But these are the ideas that I care about getting on the paper now. I'll do the essay structure and I'll throw those ideas in. So there are different ways to change this sense of the task and whether it's real or not. Many of the tasks that we have to do, particularly at university and stuff like that, are by their nature fictitious. They adjust to prove that you can. It's a valuable thing and there's nothing like experience to learn stuff. But it can be hard to motivate yourself to do things when you know that there's no actual outcome for it. But seeing an outcome, pretending there's an outcome to any extent you can, can actually help to some degree to pull you into the headspace that you would be if you were answering the question for real. And if you were answering the question for real, you would probably actually not find it difficult and procrastinate because it's not a stressful performance-based thing and because it actually is worth doing."

        "output": "Yeah, so you said the other Simon is due tonight, so I imagine, like, it's already that time that you'll end up you got to do what you got to do. But maybe there is something that is coming up over the next week, whether it's due next week or it's due sometime in the future, that you would be able to, like, after tonight, between tomorrow and next week to find something that you can book, like one or two sessions, right, whether it's on the weekend or in the evening or whatever it is, where you're intentionally maybe using a Pomodoro technique or one of those techniques from week two to get in and to get something or to make some progress on something that's not quite due yet. Do you have something in mind that you might be able to work on for that?"
    },
    {
        "instruction": "I wanted to ask a question about the time because I do have lots of issues with time, but they're different issues at different times. Sometimes I can focus well on stuff and be very productive, other times because I can't organize my thoughts or I'm just not thinking in a linear way, I can try a task and an hour later I've got one sentence on the page or something. It's like there's different experiences of time and different reasons why time is going wrong.",
        "output": "Yes, and that's where it does become quite situational. What I was referring to mainly there is the idea that a lot of people know who have ADHD, that they don't know how much time things take. So that can be rectified and figured out over time in terms of losing track or realising that sometimes. You'll be in the mode and be able to focus on those things, maybe even if they're not particularly interesting. But other times you'll really struggle get stuck too. Yeah. So there are a couple of reasons that that can happen and generally, I guess, a combination of a couple of them, but certainly ADHD or not, the more averse of a task is for any reason, the more we're going to want to avoid it. And it could be aversive because it was unpleasant last time, it could be aversive because we don't expect to do well in it or anything like that. So that can still be there. But even without that, if we've done exercise that day, that's the other one of those three commanding your focus. By the way it's exercise occurred to me now. So if we exercise that day where that's going to upregulate Norepinephrine and dopamine so, then those situations you might find easier to focus, or a situation where the stakes are higher or there's more accountability that other people would know, or you'd be letting someone down if you didn't do it then and there. Having an absolute deadline can be a useful good thing. Situations like, say, doing our tax can be really challenging because there's no absolute deadline where, like, you have to do it at a given time, so it can end up being tomorrow never comes type thing and different ones will come up as we go. But like, yeah, there definitely are these different reasons for it. But the situation, given that you've experienced a situation where you can focus sometimes, once we identify what it is about that situation that is different from the other, then you should be able to take advantage of that more willingly just by being aware of and being able to mimic it. And I've just got there. So medication, just talking about the different types of medication. So the way that it works I've mentioned is that it up regulates both the neurotransmitter dopamine and Norepinephrine that are under regulated for people with ADHD dopamine. I think I've got a section on I'm going to jump back, but I think I've got a slide on it. Okay, here we are. I may as well just go to the main slide when I'm talking about this section. So the Norepinephrine, this is related, as I was saying, to decision consolidation. This is the one that you can get more access to any time you're adrenaline. So the Pomodoro technique and stuff like that. And it means that because in the last minute, when something does have an absolute deadline or you're going to let someone down, if you don't do something that the stakes feel higher, that can adrenalize us to an upfront extent often so that we can get stuff done. It's also worth noting that if you've got two days on the weekend to do something that's going to take half a day, not only is it very common that people with ADHD will leave it to the last half of Sunday, but you might find that you're not actually able genuinely to focus on it until that time. Because it's only at that time that you are adrenalized and therefore able to convert your priorities to just that task, before which it can be very difficult without a very specific strategy like we've been talking about. Don't mean, of course, being related to the reward system. Now when we either achieve something that we see is better than expected or something happens to us that's better than expected, then we're going to get a spike in dopamine and a suppression of dopamine if something is worse than expected. But when dopamine is underregulated as it is for people with ADHD, all else being equal, then the spike is smaller and the suppression is greater. So the intrinsic feeling of achievement for people with ADHD tends to be smaller than the average person. So less kind of like internal celebration of achieving a productivity tasks and stuff like that. And the suppression is greater when we don't live up to our expectations. Meaning that that intrinsic feeling of oh crap, that didn't feel very good, that is stronger as well. General activity and the drive for stimulation because there's a higher requirement for external stimulation. People with ADHD tend to seek out novel situations where there's more stimulation, more kind of more access to potential dopamine and also seek out more stimulation. If something is boring, we tend to think of something else. At the same time. The interior cingulate cortex or ACC is an area of the brain about here that is related to slowing down enough so that we're able to do something in a different way. So when the stakes are high, like, let's say that if you're driving a car really fast versus driving slowly, so then the stakes seem higher in the sense that if you crash, it's worse, right? In that situation where the interior cingulate cortex would be active in order to make us slow down, in order to decide whether we want to do things differently because the stakes are higher. Now the dorsal at the prefrontal cortex, this is another part of the brain that is smaller and has less connections to people with ADHD. All else being equal. Both of these areas of the brain, by the way, can be built up so that's related specifically to selfcontrol or inhibitory control. And the combination of the interior cingulate cortex and endorseltic prefrontal cortex being smaller on average is that relationship with self control and the tendency to have even a higher emotional volume to move forward. There's less inhibition relative to the amount of forward push there is for a person with ADHD. Loss being equal. Just jumping back to where I was, and then we can show for a little bit. I know that was a lot. And meet the top one for me is Zoe."

You tell that to somebody without ADHD and they're like, you're a bloody nut case. Right, but when I saw that, I was like, yes, I've been after that, I didn't think it was legal to have something like that, but I want it to be painful because even if, say, let's say that you want to go to the gym and you. Decide to decline it at that time. If you get a Zap, then at least you've got a version either way to potentially balance it. And I'm really interested to see how it goes.

My role and why I got a job at school right now is that I get employed to think outside the box. And so myself and someone else is part of a team where we're trying to transform school culture into, things that a lot of people like us would not just make find more accessible, but enjoy where learning becomes.",
        "output": "Yeah, absolutely. Rather than things can be so much better in that classroom level. I remember when I was I thought about it just the other day, like, why maybe what worked out well and what worked out not so well when it came to primary school and the way that people treated things. I think I realised, and this is literally in the last week, I realised there was probably missed in terms of diagnosis of ADHD in relatively large part because there was a lot of kind of talk about being gifted and stuff. And then, so with that, they're like, oh, he's getting bored with this material. We'll give him more material that's like higher up. And it's like that's precisely perfect for somebody with ADHD. Right. So that thing worked out really well until I got to whatever grade and I'd read all the books, and then I started getting less interested in schooling. But that thing can happen to people, whether it's either something that really, really imperfect or really kind of, as it happens, quite perfect for their situation."

So it's like, sure, that may not be a sustainable goal of, like, whatever the requirement is for exercise to get ready for that, but if it gets you back over the hill, so to speak, where you've got the momentum to get back into it kind of because you've done the kind of the hard yards. You had that incentive to do the hard yards, that might be a way to get back in. But just all food for thought."

And then the friends I have got very social got lots of different friendship circles, but maintaining those relationships over the text's more complicated than ever. I avoid them. The more tired I get, the more I want to avoid them and it's really playing a bigger and bigger role and hence that feeling of having disappointed people and hence people also like doing a little micro and probably quite significant rejection. So very painful. I'm looking for some help. I need a lot of help with that.",

And then like half an hour later, whoops not supposed to be doing that, supposed to be doing this, and sort of go to it. So I'd sort of just put my phone either away where I couldn't reach it or set a timer that was visible on the phone.

But then, you know, sometimes you just can't be bothered or whatever and it just doesn't happen.",

        "output": "It's not always the same requirement for it. But you know what you miss, and you know what? At other times in your life, when you've had that. Whether it be social interaction or certain things that you enjoy doing, or parts of a good lifestyle that have worked for you in the past and oftentimes, it's just a matter of taking the wisdom from what has worked already because everybody's going to be somewhat different. There is some kind of baseline things that apply to everybody, but the type of social interaction you have in terms of what really recharges you like for some people who are quite extroverted, getting out there and partying with a bunch of people may very well be right there yet. And then other people may enjoy interacting with one-on-one or a couple of people they know well. But you just pick out the eyes of it, and you figure out what works for you. And just like anything else and the things we talked about last week, there will be fluctuations over time with these. Sometimes maybe you start a new job, and you're overwhelmed, and you've got to kind of temporarily drop these things off. That's fine. It's a matter of sometimes rebuilding them if you feel like you've got the ball at some stage, and some of these things end up not being the case for a bit. But it's just a matter of while you're doing these things regularly, the propensity to deal with things immediately and therefore not be procrastinating about them, the propensity to have a nice, like a steady emotional kind of stability and all that kind of stuff. All those things will be more easily attained when these things are happening in the background. Fun, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Have more fun. It makes you deal with stress, feel happier, and lose your temper less; it lowers cortisol levels which helps you sleep, therefore improving memory and overall performance. It's worth noting that anything that's going to improve things like the quality of sleep and whatnot will improve your actual capability intellectually and physically and everything like that. One of the quickest things when people lose even as much as like if they're an eight-hour sleeper and they get 7 hours as much as an hour of sleep is enough that you can tell with a reaction test from one day to another whether somebody is sleep deprived. Like in a simple reaction test. You don't need any fancy things for this. Get yourself a ruler and hold it so that the zero mark is at your fingers like somebody else holding it. Sorry. And then when they drop it, when you see it dropped, you grab it, and then you just measure that distance and notice that distance is longer on days when you're sleep deprived. And it's not just reaction speeds. It's our ability to make ourselves focus on those things that are really challenging or annoying or unpleasant, or mundane. It's the ability to utilise anything for which we need resources."

        "instruction": "I'm not sure. I think it's also doing it during the day because, typically, I think it's okay. I can do it at night when I've got time or whatever. I think it was definitely looking at the time that I had during the day when I was, I guess, more mentally there. Yeah, that was a big thing. Just because I did realise of an evening, I am knackered, and I'm just distracted. So I was working on it during the day, in the mornings and things like that, and I just smashed it out. I'm like, that was simple. Not simple, but that was a lot less complex than I thought it would be.",
        "output": "Yeah, it can be a really powerful technique for people just to pick the time of day just because so many people I've talked to, particularly those with ADHD, describe themselves as night hours like that. The time they focus. Some people get into the pattern of preferring that and stuff like that. But I've not found a situation so far where we have modified that from getting things done at nighttime to some other time when they're more focused in the morning or something like that where it hasn't ended up being an improvement. So, of course, no matter what time of day or night we tend to get focused that we will have, our system will be prepared to get focused to some degree at those times. So our circadian rhythms, that kind of 24-hour plane that will dictate when we have access to melatonin and GABA so that we can sleep and whatnot, will also give us it will upregulate norepinephrine at the times that we tend to focus. So if people tend to focus at maybe like late at night, then that's the time that they will find that they kind of start to get revved up. Just because that's been a pattern of behaviour that your system is trying to keep you prepared for. And oftentimes, people will say, like I'll be feeling reasonably tired, and then it gets up to like eleven or whatever time it is, and then I like I feel pumped up, ready to go again. It's like dollars to doughnuts; the pattern of behaviour that has led there has been actually getting revved up at those times. Whatever we do will end up being the thing. Just like I think I may have mentioned in the past that another thing that is regulated by circadian rhythms is a hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin makes us feel hungry around our lunchtime, sorry, around our meal times. And if we eat at a consistent time throughout the day, then that's when we're going to get a spike. And we know that because if you wait like an hour and a half to 2 hours after your it's about an hour and a half after your meal time normally goes over, then you'll find that hunger, that kind of feeling like your stomach's eating itself, it's all gone. Because it was very much like highly, highly related to ghrelin. When people fast for multiple days, and I have done up to three days myself where you find that you get the first day, you get the biggest spikes of the grill and the biggest hunger during those meal times. On the second day, you have a bit more baseline hunger at the start of it, but the spikes of ghrelin and hunger that you have around meal times are lower, and toward the end of the day, it gets easier. So they've graphed up when people find subjectively the most difficult time or when they're most hungry when they're fasting, and it's between about 20 and 24 hours, or 20 and 28 hours after that time, people find that it gets easier. And like, even to the point where, very surprisingly, you know, you can be two days into a fast and realise you're not hungry. So that was a divergence. But it's worth noting that being a spike of it, like if we snack at nighttime, then we will naturally start to crave food and feel hungry at nighttime. Because that's time we've eaten and we can get rid of that. In the same vein, when people do intermittent fasting for those who have never spent it only takes about seven to ten days or a week to a week and a half to reset their skating rhythms. For those who haven't done that with so just like not eating breakfast, for example, once they've done it for a week or two where they've just not eaten breakfast, they won't get hungry at those times anymore because they stop having that spike of growling. Hopefully, that's useful instead of diving in there."

And I'll also find maybe I'll get like spontaneously emotional. Like it just hits me out of nowhere sometimes. Yeah, sometimes you wake up in a bad mood and it's just like you just realize that you have all these things that are piling on that most of them have a time limit for and you just don't know where to start and where to go with all of that. So that's how I know I've taken on too much. And by then it's at a point where I can't exactly just dump it all, you know?",
        "output": "Yeah. And we do it. I mean, certainly, a lot of us do it all the time. And I'll go through some of the reasons now formative time of why we often do that. First, I'll just go over this section and I think that this is a bit of revision. The fact that lower tension rest is important because attention is a limited resource. Like, I was talking about this area of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It takes a lot of resources to run that. And when we are resource depleted or we're not getting enough resources or we're not getting a lot of resources to our brain, that's going to be one of the first areas that then don't get as much. So it completely makes sense that when you've got something, whether the model for self-control, the model for using that part of the brain is the strength model. And it is because they're both highly resource-intensive areas that are only going to be built up if we're actually using them to the extent that we're barely being able to make it work based on what we have. So we have to be like delaying gratification or deciding to do things that we don't want to do and stuff like that. Every time we administer that will over ourselves. Basically, the difference between what we would like to have done and what we would like to do. The gap between those two things is self-control. It's also useful to point out that so using a technique like getting yourself fascinated with something and therefore kind of hyper-focusing on it, tends not to take as much mental effort and stuff like that in a sense per time that you're doing it, you're doing it for 12 hours. That's going to take a bit of mental effort, but it doesn't take as much mental effort in a sense to do those things because where was I? Sorry, I lost my train of thought there. To do those things. I forgot what those things were."

And so I always kind of a lot of facades, trying to work really hard, being doing okay. I am clever, I'm intelligent and put everything together and so yeah, it was pretty tricky, pretty tough. The social stuff seems to be pretty okay though. I was always kind of a people person and after high school into uni. So I was studying things that I was interested in, philosophy and education, teaching and the practicality of education and teaching. Currently in my school right now. And yes, it was really great academically. It wasn't easy, but it got better. Yeah, socially was awesome. And then I had a girlfriend at the time was studying clinical psychology. She was like, you know what, maybe you need to get tested. And I got test and diagnosed about four years ago and just before that I was certainly a bit of a risk taker in trying a lot of different kinds of prescription drugs and illicit drugs too. And so that just contextualizes why the context of someone handed me a Dexy and after conversation got ADHD. I was about to get diagnosed or about to get tested for it, and I took it at the end of a work day couple of days later, and it was like the static just dissipated. And I didn't realize that my whole life. There was a static that meant that I could only hear, like 40% of what people were saying. And it was like cognitive glasses got put on my head.",

There's a video on my YouTube channel on addiction specifically, if you're interested really in that, but some things. So when you make things less convenient, the less convenient it is to do the thing that you attempted to do, the less self control it takes to not do it. Let's say I wanted to cut down drinking. And the difference between having to walk like there's a shop within 100 meters of my place that I could buy beer from, but that compared with having a beer sitting here, compared with having a beer in my fridge, compared with having a beer in my cupboard. So I'd have to put in the freezer for a beer to get cold. These are different levels of the degree of convenience that I have. And you want to start with the least comfort, and then as you become more confident and you become better at withstanding that temptation because you're out of the habit, then you can deal with more and more risky situations through situations that more lend themselves to temptation."

But listening to your earlier talk, I think perhaps if I take more of a specific and shorter goal in terms of, let's just run for 30 seconds, 1-minute walk or five times, just to build it. Up might be a better way to go about it rather than say I did 1 minute of running before for ten minutes, 1 minute off, 1 minute on, and therefore I should be able to do it again.

The converse to that in this situation is, like, once you've done a little bit of exercise, you're actually in a situation where you're more likely to feel able to do a bit more and a bit more just because you've got a small win up your sleeve.

But then I'm writing a letter to a GP. If I were a betting man, maybe 10% of red and that's hard to convince myself to do versus send someone a letter and then I get one back and there's a conversation for you guys.

So HowTo ADHD is a popular YouTube channel that you may have come across like a youngish like late 20s girl who has ADHD who does some really good videos about the different aspects of it. But anyway, so she was talking about her and her partner, who both have ADHD with dishes in their house, given they live together, so they both have a poster with their names on it. And when they do the dishes, they get to move their name further away. And the name that's closest to it determines the person who next has to wash it. And even though, like, you know, you washed it and that means that the next person has to do it next and all that kind of stuff, being able to move, that makes it feel real enough that there's a reward directly after doing the dishes. And it makes the overall task less aversive and easier to motivate yourself to do over time. And the same with using particular rewards and stuff like that. Stickers healthy treats or other treats in moderation. Race yourself a housemate or a friend, and find some ways to gamify it. But I just want to be clear with the things that we choose. Many people, particularly those who beat themselves up about procrastinating and not getting focused when they want to and stuff like that, will have a self-punishment angle where it's like, well, I'm going to stay inside. All day unless I get this done or I'm going to and basically using things that you need regularly, like socializing and fun and physical activity and stuff like that, as the reward and not doing them. And I absolutely don't suggest that there are some things like those that are necessary for our productivity over time and should not be sacrificed. But like say, for example, that you were doing some homework or something like that and you had some friends or you were doing some work, some work from your work, and you're doing it from home, whatever it is. But you've got some friends who want to meet you for lunch at a cafe or something like that. You could decide, alright, so I'm definitely going to do that because I can fit it in as possible. That's an excellent opportunity to socialise it'll break up my day. Sweet. That's definite. What can I reward myself with though? That can be like you get a standard latte or you get like, you know, your caramel mocker crazy, whatever it is. It's something that is peripheral and unnecessary but it's a nice little you only get if you do the thing. It's essential not to use something that you essentially need over time as a reward and, therefore, that you don't get it\u2014reminders and Planning is a task, too and is often overlooked. Decide what must be done. Even like the day before, it can be helpful to spend five to ten minutes a day before you want to get some stuff done that's mainly not fun or that you've been avoiding or something like that because it's such a small amount of time and it's not associated with doing the whole task."

        "instruction": "Hello. I have two screens because I'm using my iPad, and everything is squished. So I'm looking at you over there and then looking at the slides over here. Anyway, so I don't have an official ADHD diagnosis, but I've been seeing a psychologist for like, I think, six years and funnily enough, I actually started seeing her after dropping out of Uni, which looking back now, makes a lot of sense. But, yeah, I had a lot going on at the time anyway, and so over the five or six years, I've. Just kind of, I don't know, been really slowly narrowing down to what's really been going on. And I wasn't really like in my head, ADHD was just like that kid at school that was, like, really annoying and wouldn't shut up and like, the naughty kids and that kind of thing. So it wasn't really like in my awareness outside of that. She brought it up, and she liked it, printed this thing for me to take home to highlight all the things that were relevant to me, and I lit the whole thing up a Christmas tree. Everything was relevant, basically, and I never felt more seen or heard in my life. And even like, in this group right now, it's just amazing to see, like, my experience mirrored with, like, everyone else. So I'm not looking for a specific actual official diagnosis. And I don't want to go on medication either. But, this is my starting point. I'm like, yeah, only just beginning this journey, so hoping to get something out of this 100%.",
        "output": "And I mean, generally speaking, for people who probably have ADHD but don't necessarily want to take the medication and aren't, like studying where they might be able to get some special exemption or something, I wouldn't necessarily suggest that they should go and get a formal diagnosis unless it's essential to them for some reason. Because on a practical level, those are the main things. It's usually access to medication or access to special considerations, but actually, like the practical gain of having that. But it can be really important for people to have the headspace, the understanding that they're not alone. They're the only people in that boat, for sure. Thanks, Zoe. Next person that I've got on my screen is Cass. Is that the right way to say it?"

    {
        "instruction": "I struggle to get started with things. What about that first bit of time, trying to get into some work?",
        "output": "Doing the day before can be easier to motivate yourself to do because it's such a small task and once you've done that, the next day you're less likely to get distracted and stuff like that. More likely to get some stuff done because there's a sense of having started it ripped off that bandaid, making sure that you have reminders and everything like that, that you've planned out and made sure that you reasonably have enough time to do everything that you need to do. This is really crucial as well. Starting is its own task as well. So open the documents, put in the title, paste details and into the form structure, then chill and work on it when you're ready because that is a separate task that doesn't have to be combined with the whole task. So you can just get that one done at a different point and therefore more quickly because it's just a tiny amount of stuff. Bonus tip for writing give yourself permission to write garbage. For anyone who wants to write their best, who has a tendency to have high standards about their writing, it can lead to a lot of procrastination kind of looking at the blank page and thinking well, there's no way to the blank page, in a sense is perfect and it's never going to be perfect after that."

    {
        "instruction": "Yeah, I think another one of my goals is to change my profile picture from me on my honeymoon, drinking beer from ten years ago. So that will be something I'll do this weekend too. But yeah, certainly I think I try and do that for, like, yard stuff, mowing the lawns and things like that. I try and say, all right, I'll get that, I'll do that on Saturday afternoon, and then on Sunday, I can relax and not have to endure that sort of undercurrent of guilt and anxiety where I learn to dread the task instead of just sitting down and burrowing into it. And I find it flows very well once I get started on it. I'm getting reasonably good marks for my classes, but that hurdle of getting there and getting started is tricky.",
        "output": "So then that might mean using a technique like getting everything ready the day before, just using. Five to ten minutes just to clear the desk. If it's a computer-based task, close down things unrelated to it, open up things so that you've got everything ready and then that starting point the next day when you want to get started on Saturday. So that could be something you actually set a reminder for. Plan on a Friday night, tomorrow night, and then on Saturday, you've got a running start. So that tends to be really helpful with that starting part. And if you find that you usually kind of get into it from there, then that might be all you need. Otherwise, it might be a combination of a couple. But that's definitely something to try because, like, if the goal is trying something that you haven't tried, even if that isn't the thing that you end up utilising in the end, that is a useful thing because you're gaining more knowledge about what works for you. All right, Nolini, I think that will be everybody. Noini, are you there?"

        "instruction": "It's all over the place. It depends. It'll be like this week, I'm like emergency relief, so someone will be sick depending on their shift. I would either do nine to two or twelve to five, but then other times, it'll be like a week of twelve to 5%. We'll have a holiday or whatever, so there's no consistency at all in it.",
        "output": "Some suggestions I have that might work for you, like yoga, of course, is one. There are apps, there are YouTube videos and stuff like that. Doing something like that, that's potentially new, might be a good way because there's diaphragmatic breathing involved. That should actually lower that kind of adrenaline. The other one is if you have any friends who live nearby or someone you could be walking with. So there's a social element of just chatting while you do it."
